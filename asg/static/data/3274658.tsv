Robustness of signature verification systems to imitators with increasing skills	[]	F. Alonso-Fernandez, J. Fierrez, A. Gilperez, J. Galbally, and J. Ortega-Garcia 2009. Robustness of signature verification systems to imitators with increasing skills. In 10th Int. Conf. on Document Analysis and Recognition	In this paper, we study the impact of an incremental level of skill in the forgeries against signature verification systems. Experiments are carried out using both off-line systems, involving the discrimination of signatures written on a piece of paper, and on-line systems, in which dynamic information of the signing process (such as velocity and acceleration) is also available. We use for our experiments the BiosecurID database, which contains both on-line and offline versions of signatures, acquired in four sessions across a 4 month time span with incremental level of skill in the forgeries for different sessions. We compare several scenarios with different size and variability of the enrolment set, showing that the problem of skilled forgeries can be alleviated as we consider more signatures for enrolment.	Nowadays, due to the expansion of the networked society, an automatic correct assessment of identity is a crucial point. This has resulted in the establishment of a new research and technology area known as biometrics <NO>, which refers to automatic recognition of an individual based on behavioral and/or anatomical characteristics (e.g., fingerprints, face, iris, voice, signature, etc.). The handwritten signature is one of the most widely used individual authentication methods due to its acceptance in government, legal and commercial transactions <NO>. There are two main signature recognition approaches <NO>: offline and on-line. Off-line methods consider only the signature image, so only static information is available for the recognition task. On-line systems use pen tablets or digitizers which capture dynamic information such as velocity and acceleration of the signing process, providing a richer source of information and more reliability <NO>. Despite the evident advantages of biometric systems, they are not free from external attacks which can decrease their level of security. Thus, it is of utmost importance to analyze the vulnerabilities of biometric systems, in order to find their limitations and to develop useful countermeasures for foreseeable attacks <NO>. Like other biometric systems, signature verification systems are exposed to forgeries, which can be easily performed by direct observation and learning of the signature by the forger. Signature verification systems are usually evaluated by analyzing their ability to accept genuine signatures and to reject forgeries. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of signature verification systems to forgeries created with an increasing level of skill. For this purpose, we use the BiosecurID database <NO>, which contains both on-line and off-line versions of signatures acquired in several sessions with an incremental level of skill in the forgeries. For the verification experiments, three machine experts exploiting information at different levels have been used (one on-line <NO> and two off-line <NO>). Several enrolment strategies with different size and variability of the enrolment set are studied. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The problem of forgeries with different level of skill is briefly addressed in Section 2. The three machine experts used are described in Section 3. The experimental framework used, including the database and protocol, is described in Section 4. The results obtained are presented in Section 5, and conclusions are finally drawn in Section 6.	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2009.261	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Alonso-Fernandez, et al.

Online signature verification based on generative models	['Mixture Model (GMM) <NO> or discriminative ones such', 'a study of generative models, primarily the HMM based approaches has been presented in <NO>.', 'There are also a few recent works in which ten reference signatures are used for the experimentation, particularly in <NO>, <NO>, <NO>.']	E. Argones Rua, and J.L. Alba Castro 2012. Online signature verification based on generative models. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part B (Cybernetics) 42,	The success of generative models for online signature verification has motivated many research works on this topic. These systems may use hidden Markov models (HMMs) in two different modes: user-specific HMM (US-HMM) and user-adapted universal background models (UBMs) (UA-UBMs). Verification scores can be obtained from likelihood ratios and a distance measure on the Viterbi decoded state sequences. This paper analyzes several factors that can modify the behavior of these systems and which have not been deeply studied yet. First, we study the influence of the feature set choice, paying special attention to the role of dynamic information order, suitability of feature sets on each kind of generative model-based system, and the importance of inclination angles and pressure. Moreover, this analysis is also extended to the influence of the HMM complexity in the performance of the different approaches. For this study, a set of experiments is performed on the publicly available MCYT-100 database using only skilled forgeries. These experiments provide interesting outcomes. First, the Viterbi path evidences a notable stability for most of the feature sets and systems. Second, in the case of US-HMM systems, likelihood evidence obtains better results when lowest order dynamics are included in the feature set, while likelihood ratio obtains better results in UA-UBM systems when lowest dynamics are not included in the feature set. Finally, US-HMM and UA-UBM systems can be used together for improved verification performance by fusing at the score level the Viterbi path information from the US-HMM system and the likelihood ratio evidence from the UA-UBM system. Additional comparisons to other state-of-the-art systems, from the ESRA 2011 signature evaluation contest, are also reported, reinforcing the high performance of the systems and the generality of the experimental results described in this paper.	"NOWADAYS, the society demands secure means for per-son authentication. Traditional authentication methods are based on the knowledge (password, Personal Identification Number numbers) or on the possession of a token (Identificator card, keys), which can be forgotten or stolen. This fact places a lot of attention in biometrics as an alternative method for person authentication and identification. Biometrics is defined in <NO> as the use of physiological or behavioral characteristics for person recognition, and hence, they are not affected by the disadvantages of the traditional authentication methods since they cannot be forgotten or stolen.
Biometrics can be coarsely categorized into behavioral and physiological biometrics. Physiological biometrics are based on measurable physiological traits, such as fingerprints or the iris pattern. Behavioral biometrics are based on measurements extracted from an activity performed by the user, in a conscious or unconscious way, and they are inherent to his/her own personality or learned behavior, although influenced also by the physical characteristics of the person. In this sense, behavioral biometrics have some interesting advantages, like user acceptance and cancelability, but they still lack the same level of uniqueness as physiological biometrics. Among all the biometric traits that can be categorized as pure behavioral, the signature, and the way that we sign, is the one that has the widest social acceptance for identity authentication.
On the basis of the signature acquisition method, signature recognition methods can be categorized into static (or offline) and dynamic (or online) methods. Offline signature verification uses the shape of the signature to authenticate the signer. Online signature verification uses dynamic characteristics of the signature (time-dependent signals) to authenticate the signer. Learning the dynamics of the real signer is a difficult task for an impostor, compared to replicate only the shape of a signature. Moreover, the use of devices with built-in pen input such as smartphones, Personal Digital Assistants, or tablet PCs has been spread in the last years. These facts have motivated great research efforts in the last decade on dynamic or online signature verification, as reviewed in <NO>."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2188508	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Argones et al. [NO] analyzes several factors that can modify the behavior of these systems and which have not been deeply studied yet. 
Biometric template protection using universal background models: An application to online signature	['Recently, Argones et al <NO> have proposed a set of HMM model features from a universal background model.', 'Other papers <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, and <NO> choose the first k samples, according to the original order in which the data was acquired, as the training set.', 'There are also a few recent works in which ten reference signatures are used for the experimentation, particularly in <NO>, <NO>, <NO>.']	E. Argones Rua, E. Maiorana, J.L. Alba Castro, and P. Campisi 2012. Biometric template protection using universal background models: An application to online signature. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	Data security and privacy are crucial issues to be addressed for assuring a successful deployment of biometrics-based recognition systems in real life applications. In this paper, a template protection scheme exploiting the properties of universal background models, eigen-user spaces, and the fuzzy commitment cryptographic protocol is presented. A detailed discussion on the security and information leakage of the proposed template protection system is given. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is investigated with application to online signature recognition. The given experimental results, evaluated on the public MCYT signature database, show that the proposed system can guarantee competitive recognition accuracy while providing protection to the employed biometric data.	"THE USE of biometric data to identify people raises sev-eral security concerns not affecting other approaches employed for automatic people recognition <NO>. If a characteristic is somehow stolen or copied, its owner cannot use it anymore, making it possible for other people to impersonate him using the compromised feature. The use of biometrics also poses many privacy concerns <NO>: when an individual gives out his biometrics, either willingly or unwillingly, he can disclose sensitive information about his personality and health status <NO> which can be used to profile him. Moreover, data collected for some specific purposes might be used in the long run for different ones, a possibility usually referred to as function creep. Also, the uniqueness characterizing biometric data, and the fact that biometrics are permanently associated with their users, can be exploited to perform an unauthorized tracking of the activities of the subjects enrolled in different biometric databases. The use of biometrics can also raise cultural and religious concerns. Therefore, the need to protect privacy, both from a procedural point of view and from a technological point of view, arises. Currently deployed systems typically employ classical cryptographic techniques to securely store data. However, even if the stored data are kept secure when not used, decryption has to be performed during authentication, thus leaving the biometric information unprotected. It is rather desirable to permanently keep secret an acquired biometrics, and also to be able to revoke or to renew a template when compromised, as well as to obtain from the same biometrics different keys to access different locations, either physical or logical. Therefore a template protection scheme should satisfy the following properties: 1) Renewability: for each user, it should be possible to revoke a compromised template and reissue a new one based on the same biometric data (revocability). Moreover, each template generated from a biometrics should not match with the others previously generated from the same data (diversity). The renewability property is needed to ensure the user’s privacy.
2) Security: it must be impossible or computationally hard to obtain the original biometric template from the stored and secured one. This property is needed to prevent an adversary from creating fake biometric traits from stolen templates. In fact, although it was commonly believed that it is not possible to reconstruct an original biometric characteristic from the corresponding extracted template, some concrete counter examples, which contradict this assumption, have been provided in the recent literature, as in <NO>. 3) Performance: the recognition performance should not degrade significantly with the introduction of a template protection scheme, with respect to the performance of a nonprotected system.
The approaches followed to design biometric template protection schemes able to properly satisfy each of the aforementioned properties have been categorized into feature transformations and biometric cryptosystems <NO>. When implementing a feature transformation approach, a function dependent on some parameters, which can be used as a key, is applied to the input biometrics. Invertible functions are employed in salting schemes, whose security therefore relies on the protection of the defining transformation parameters <NO>. The loss or disclosure of the key, therefore, results in serious security issues <NO>. One-way functions are employed in noninvertible transform approaches <NO>, which produce templates from which it is computationally hard to retrieve the original data, even if the transforms’ defining parameters are known. However, it is in general difficult to quantitatively determine the actual difficulty of the invertibility. In <NO>, noninvertible functions are applied to face images to obtain transformed templates which, however, allows human inspection. In <NO>, Cartesian, polar, and functional noninvertible transformations are used to modify the fingerprint minutiae pattern. However, only a small fraction of the resulting data is in practice noninvertible <NO> and the scheme is vulnerable to a record multiplicity attack, where an adversary who acquires two or more distinct stored templates is able to recover the original information <NO>. In <NO>, noninvertible transforms designed for biometrics which can be expressed in terms of a set of sequences have also been described, and a detailed security and renewability analysis is provided. Biometric cryptosystems provide the means to integrate cryptographic protocols with biometric recognition. They can be further classified into key generation schemes, where binary keys are directly created from the acquired biometrics, and key binding schemes, which store information obtained by combining biometric data with randomly selected keys. The main issue characterizing key generation approaches regards the possibility of creating multiple keys from the same biometrics without using any external data, and the stability of the resulting cryptographic key <NO>. Moreover, due to the difficulties in managing the intraclass variability of biometric data, the recognition performance of such schemes are typically significantly lower than those of their unprotected counterparts <NO>. A key binding system can be twofold: it can be used to protect a biometric template by means of a binary key, thus securing a biometric recognition system, or to release a cryptographic key only when its owner presents a specific biometric trait. In both cases a secret key, independent of the considered biometrics, is combined during enrollment with a reference template to generate the so-called helper data, from which it should be impossible, or at least computationally hard, to retrieve information about the original biometric trait or the key. The helper data is then used in conjunction with a query biometrics during authentication to retrieve the secret. Error-correcting codes are commonly employed to manage the intraclass variability of the considered templates. Among the cryptographic protocols most employed in a key binding scenario, we can mention the fuzzy commitment <NO>, already applied to ear <NO>, fingerprint <NO>, face <NO>, iris <NO>, and online signatures <NO>. The fuzzy vault scheme <NO> is able to manage biometrics represented as unordered sets of data, and has been applied to signature <NO>, face <NO>, and iris <NO>, although it has been found to be vulnerable to different attacks <NO>. Also Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) has been proposed to bind biometric characteristics with binary keys <NO>, providing an increased flexibility in managing the templates’ intraclass variability. It is worth pointing out that both feature transformation approaches and biometric cryptosystems have their own pros and cons. Specifically, it is difficult to define noninvertible transformations which preserve the discriminability of the templates, and it is hard to properly provide renewability with key binding schemes relying on helper data. Hybrid approaches <NO> able to exploit the advantages of both biometric cryptosystems and feature transformation approaches would be needed, therefore, to cope with all the requirements of a template protection system. In this paper, we present a general hybrid approach which properly guarantees the necessary protection to biometric templates by exploiting the properties of Universal Background Models (UBMs). Specifically, UBMs are statistical descriptors employed to represent person-independent biometric observations. They have been extensively employed for biometric authentication purposes for speaker <NO>, for face <NO>, and for gait <NO> recognition, while some analyses have been made in <NO> for online signature recognition. UBM’s parameters are estimated by processing a large number of biometric acquisitions, taken from as many different subjects as possible. The biometrics of a specific user is then modeled by adapting the well-trained parameters in the UBM to the characteristics of the acquired user’s traits. The traditional approach for user verification in UBM-based systems relies on a likelihood ratio evaluation, which requires the use of the original user-adapted models. It is here demonstrated that UBMs can also be employed to provide a parametric feature representation which can be exploited in a key binding scheme, thus preserving the user’s privacy. The feature transformation part of the proposed protection scheme relies on the use of UBMs, also employed to provide renewability, while the cryptosystem part is given by a user-adaptive version of the fuzzy commitment cryptographic protocol <NO>, which is exploited to provide template noninvertibility and to manage the intraclass variability of the users’ biometrics. As a proof of concept, the presented protection scheme is applied to online signature biometrics to verify its effectiveness. The present paper is organized as follows. UBM-based biometric modeling and verification is presented in Section II. The proposed protected system is described in Section III, where a detailed discussion on feature and error correction code selection is carried out and security, privacy, and renewability issues are deeply analyzed. The application of the proposed approach to online signature biometrics is presented in Section IV. Eventually, the experimental results are presented in Section V, while some conclusions are drawn in Section VI."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2168213	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Argones et al.

The 4NSigComp2010 off-line signature verification competition: Scenario 2	['This procedure is conducted with two off-line signature databases, namely the GPDS-300 <NO> and MCYT-75 <NO> alongwith four published state-of-the-art-ASVs so as to avoid biased results and to obtain more consistent and general conclusions.']	M. Blumenstein, M.A. Ferrer, and J.F. Vargas 2010. The 4NSigComp2010 off-line signature verification competition: Scenario 2. In Int. Conf. on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition,	The objective of this competition (4NSigComp2010) is to ascertain the performance of automatic off-line signature verifiers to evaluate recent technology developments in the areas of document analysis and machine learning. The current paper focuses on the second scenario, which aims at performance evaluation of off-line signature verification systems on a newly-created large dataset that comprises genuine, simulated signatures produced by unskilled imitators or random signatures (genuine signatures from other writers). Ten systems were evaluated, and some interesting results are presented in terms of accuracy and execution time. The top ranking system attained an overall error of 8.94%. This result interestingly correlates with the top ranking accuracy achieved in a previous signature verification competition at ICDAR 2009.	"Automatic verification of a signature, a behavioural biometric, can be performed using a tablet with a stylus or using the signature of a scanned image. The former is called on-line verification and the latter is called off-line verification. Off-line verification has several advantages over its on-line counterpart. Firstly, it has widely been accepted in society. Secondly, it is more convenient as it does not require any special instruments. Thirdly, with the large amount of bank cheques, credit card authorisation forms, or legal documents still being signed every day, off-line verification can be considered commercially important.
Scenario 2 of the 4NSigComp2010 competition at ICFHR 2010 has been formulated given the intent interest in off-line signature verification. The second scenario has been primarily concerned with the detection of skilled versus non-skilled simulated signatures and aims at evaluating the performance of signature verification systems in a security-less critical environment. The questioned signatures can either be genuine (written by the reference writer), or forged (simulated by other writers than the reference writer), or a random forgery (genuine signature of other writers).
The current paper reports the outcomes for Scenario 2 of the 4NSigComp2010 competition. The remainder of this paper is divided into five sections. Section 2 outlines the participants in this competition, Section 3 discusses the signature database employed, Section 4 elaborates on Systems Evaluation and Section 5 presents the results obtained. Finally, Section 6 provides some concluding remarks."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2010.117	2	['sample']	['signature_identification', 'chain_code', 'code_direction', 'modified_chain', 'line_signatures']	['chain_code_direction', 'modified_chain_code', 'segmented_signature_image', 'signature_identification_proposed', 'line_signature_verification']	This result interestingly correlates with the top ranking accuracy achieved in a previous signature verification competition at ICDAR 2009 [NO].
Generation of duplicated off-line signature images for verification systems	[]	M. Diaz, M. A Ferrer, G. S Eskander, and R. Sabourin 2017. Generation of duplicated off-line signature images for verification systems. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 39,	Biometric researchers have historically seen signature duplication as a procedure relevant to improving the performance of automatic signature verifiers. Different approaches have been proposed to duplicate dynamic signatures based on the heuristic affine transformation, nonlinear distortion and the kinematic model of the motor system. The literature on static signature duplication is limited and as far as we know based on heuristic affine transforms and does not seem to consider the recent advances in human behavior modeling of neuroscience. This paper tries to fill this gap by proposing a cognitive inspired algorithm to duplicate off-line signatures. The algorithm is based on a set of nonlinear and linear transformations which simulate the human spatial cognitive map and motor system intra-personal variability during the signing process. The duplicator is evaluated by increasing artificially a training sequence and verifying that the performance of four state-of-the-art off-line signature classifiers using two publicly databases have been improved on average as if we had collected three more real signatures.	"FOR centuries, the handwritten signature has beenaccepted world-wide for the purpose of authentication. Classical applications include the legal validation of documents such as contracts, last wills or testaments, corporative tax statements, financial transfers and so on. It leads forensic scientists, graphologists, neurological practitioners and therapists among others to be interested in the creation and validity of handwritten signatures. This interest is manifested in many publications and surveys <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO> published in the literature during previous decades. However, modeling its intra-personal variability is still an open challengewhich has caught the attention of researchers on pattern recognition andmachine intelligence.
It is important to understand intra-personal variability of the signatures of a signer. Its modeling allows the widening of the distinction between genuine and non-genuine signatures. The generation of duplicated specimens with realistic appearance helps in gaining a better understanding of signature execution from several neuroscientific perspectives. This also supports coherent decision making in psychology and forensic science and assists in optimizing speed and performance for indexing purposes.
This paper is focused onmodeling intra-personal variability for duplicating static signatures. In this context, duplicating a signature means generating artificially a new specimen from a real or several real signatures. Among its advantages, signature duplication can improve the training of ASV systems, allows the carrying out of statistically meaningful evaluations, enlarges the number of signatures in databases, can match the baseline performances for real signatures, which are often difficult to obtain, and can improve the performances of existing automatic signature verifiers.
According to the literature, there are three methods of signature duplication: iÞ the creation of dynamic (on-line) signatures by using real on-line samples (On-2-On); iiÞ the creation of static (off-line) signatures by using dynamic specimens (On-2-Off) and iiiÞ the production of signature images (off-line) from static signatures (Off-2-Off). Note that on-line signature generation from off-line specimens (Off-2On) remains to the best of our knowledge an open issue.
Most of the recent advances in modeling intra-personal variability are focused on on-line signatures. For this category of signature capture we can find how, by applying random and affine deformations, it is possible to improve the performance of an HMM-based classifier <NO>. In <NO> another method is studied for increasing the training set on the basis of a clonal selection of the enrolled signatures without modifying either the diversity of the overall set or the sparse feature distribution. Also, in Diaz et al. <NO>, the kinematic theory of rapid movement is applied to enlarge the enrolled signature data set. Furthermore, the resultant set has been used for testing purposes in <NO>.
There are other proposals in the literature focused on the generation of signature images from on-line signatures <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. The common tendency is to apply different methods to dynamic signatures since these record the kinematic and the timing order in which the traces are registered. Once a new trajectory is obtained, the samples of the new specimen are interpolated in order to create new images. Then, an off-line automatic classifier is used to assess the performance improvement. Parallel to this approach, a method of generating enhanced synthetic signatures images has been formulated using a novel architecture to improve the performance of dynamic verifiers <NO>.
In our review of previous work, we have found little on duplication from off-line to off-line signatures. One example is in <NO> where an off-line signature dataset composed of 6 genuine specimens per user and 38 signers is enlarged by applying affine transformations to the original signatures. Since the database contained only genuine signatures, this study was focused only on recognition. The authors did not include the deliberate forgery test. Although the authors enlarged the training set, the paper scarcely addressed either how the duplicated signatures were constructed or gave reference to the cognitive signing procedure.
In order to locate in the current literature the work we report here, Table 1 summarizes schematically the state-ofthe-art in duplicated signature generation. This analysis reveals the need for more research in duplicating off-line signatures from off-line real signatures.
As well as covering geometrical and affine image deformations, the work reported in this paper is addressed at filling the gap between heuristic methods used for off-line signature duplication and methods for intra-personal variability modeling. The techniques we develop are based on human behavior, as examined by neuroscience. Specifically, a duplication procedure is proposed on the basis of modeling neuromotor equivalence theory <NO>, which divides human action into effector dependent and effector independent parts of the signing procedure. Note that we do not pretend to model human behavior as neuroscience does: we simply use ideas from neuroscience to generate signature duplicates. Our results are encouraging.
The realism of the intra-personal variability model is evaluated by increasing a training sequence with duplicates and ascertaining the improvement in performance of four different state-of-the-art generative classifiers. So as to consider as many aspects of the variability as possible, we have chosen verifiers which are based on different features and classifiers. Additionally, we have used two different public datasets. The improved performance after training with the enlarged set is discussed as well as the complementary information contained in data produced by the cognitive inspired duplication algorithm.
The reminder of this paper has the following organization. Section 2 surveys the cognitive ideas used to design our method which is the algorithm detailed in Section 3. Section 4 describes the method used to evaluate the duplicator, while Sections 5 and 6 present the results and conclusions respectively."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2560810	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Diaz, et al.

A new algorithm and system for the characterization of handwriting strokes with delta-lognormal parameters	[]	M. Djioua, and R. Plamondon 2009. A new algorithm and system for the characterization of handwriting strokes with delta-lognormal parameters. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 31,	In this paper, we present a new analytical method for estimating the parameters of Delta-Lognormal functions and characterizing handwriting strokes. According to the Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements, these parameters contain information on both the motor commands and the timing properties of a neuromuscular system. The new algorithm, called XZERO, exploits relationships between the zero crossings of the first and second time derivatives of a lognormal function and its four basic parameters. The methodology is described and then evaluated under various testing conditions. The new tool allows a greater variety of stroke patterns to be processed automatically. Furthermore, for the first time, the extraction accuracy is quantified empirically, taking advantage of the exponential relationships that link the dispersion of the extraction errors with its signal-to-noise ratio. A new extraction system which combines this algorithm with two other previously published methods is also described and evaluated. This system provides researchers involved in various domains of pattern analysis and artificial intelligence with new tools for the basic study of single strokes as primitives for understanding rapid human movements.	"HANDWRITING strokes constitute a specific class of rapidhuman movements. They have been intensively used and studied in many fields of research. For example, various online handwriting pattern analysis and recognition methods represent a complex pattern, like a graph, a letter, a word, a signature, etc., as made up of simple handwriting strokes superimposed <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. In motor control, these strokes are considered as primitives from which complex movements are assumed to be planned and executed <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. In the forensic sciences, a detailed study of individual stroke patterns, focusing on tiny variations, often constitutes the grounds for a decision about the authenticity of a signature or a document <NO>, <NO>. In education, various interactive teaching methods have been developed to reproduce letters and words from the concatenation of neat strokes <NO>, <NO>. Similarly, strokes are analyzed to study handwriting deficits in children <NO>, <NO>, as well as for training patients with writer’s cramp <NO>. In the neurosciences, strokes are investigated to characterize neurodegenerative processes like Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease <NO>, <NO>, and multiple sclerosis <NO>, and in the diagnosis of dyspraxia <NO>, as well as to assess recovery in the rehabilitation of patients having suffered cerebrovascular accidents <NO> or to assess the severity of their loss of visuospatial capacity <NO>. Strokes are also investigated in studies dealing with drug treatments <NO>, <NO>, as well as nicotine <NO> or caffeine <NO> effects and alcohol intoxication <NO>. In anthropomorphic robotics, the superimposition of handwriting strokes is exploited to explore the biomechanical principles employed by humans to produce movements, and later to apply them in the control of a robot arm <NO>, <NO>. Recently, synthetic strokes have been proposed for cybersecurity applications <NO>.
Many of these examples emphasize the need to study the basic properties of single strokes for a realistic analysis and understanding of how the motor control system performs complex movements. The cornerstone of this whole methodology is then to understand the genesis of strokes, since this reflects some of the fundamental properties of a writer’s neuromuscular system, as well as some of the basic features of the motor control strategies employed to produce these simple movements. Among these basic features, the most remarkable is the invariance of the velocity profile of the end-effector of a subject performing a rapid stroke over a wide range of movement size and speed <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. Its asymmetric bell shape is considered a fundamental property reflecting the synergetic activity of a large number of neuromotor networks <NO>, <NO>, <NO>.
Many studies have been conducted from this perspective to model the various processes involved in the production of single strokes. These models can be classified in various categories. Neural network models <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO> have been developed to study the emergence of invariants in arm movements, velocity invariance being considered as the product of an intrinsic property of the differential equation

network describing the dynamics of the system. Other approaches, like dynamic models, focus on the mass-spring characteristics of muscles <NO>, <NO> or on the changes in equilibrium points <NO> to understand trajectory formation. Generalized motor program models <NO>, <NO> rely on different representations of the action plan <NO> or on various stochastic properties of strokes <NO>. Finally, principle-oriented models track the velocity invariance problem with various minimization criteria: minimum time <NO>, minimum acceleration <NO>, minimum jerk <NO>, minimum snap <NO>, and minimum torque changes <NO>. These models generally provide, directly or indirectly, an analytical expression describing the velocity profile. However, not all these models can be integrated into the design of practical applications like those mentioned above. For example, neural networks are preferable for simulating learning mechanisms, and analytical models for studying basic skills. Some models require too many parameters and are not of practical use, although they might be essential, from a neuroscience perspective, for developing theories of human motor behavior.
Among these various computational models and approaches, the Kinematic Theory <NO> has been found to be successful in reproducing the various invariants observed in rapid strokes <NO>. So far, few applications based on this theory, or inspired by it, have been developed <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. This is mainly due to the lack of a robust and efficient software tool (a parameter extraction system) which can accurately fit any stroke velocity profile with a minimum reconstruction error.
In this paper, we propose a new analytical algorithm to improve the performances of the existing extraction system, and to enlarge the range of velocity profiles that can be processed automatically. Furthermore, this study introduces a methodology to quantify the accuracy of the extraction results under noise constraints by constructing a confidence interval for each extracted parameter value. Indeed, to apply such models particularly in forensics, educational, and biomedical applications dealing with real data, parameter estimation should be conducted accurately and produce confidence intervals, which can be used, for example, in the classification of genuine signatures and forgeries or in the detection of incapacities in normal and compromised students or in diseased individuals.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, a brief overview of the Kinematic Theory and its Delta-Lognormal model is presented, while the current status of the extraction problem is reported in Section 3. The new XZERO algorithm is described in detail in Section 4. The performance results obtained under ideal and noisy conditions are presented and discussed in Section 5. In Section 6, a complete extraction system is proposed and the methodology used to quantify its accuracy is set out. Typical examples involving real data are reported in Section 7 to highlight the power of the upgraded DeltaLognormal extraction system."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.264	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Djioua, et al.

A behavioral handwriting model for static and dynamic signature synthesis	[]	M. A Ferrer, M. Diaz, C. Carmona-Duarte, and A. Morales 2017. A behavioral handwriting model for static and dynamic signature synthesis. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 39,	The synthetic generation of static handwritten signatures based on motor equivalence theory has been recently proposed for biometric applications. Motor equivalence divides the human handwriting action into an effector dependent cognitive level and an effector independent motor level. The first level has been suggested by others as an engram, generated through a spatial grid, and the second has been emulated with kinematic filters. Our paper proposes a development of this methodology in which we generate dynamic information and provide a unified comprehensive synthesizer for both static and dynamic signature synthesis. The dynamics are calculated by lognormal sampling of the 8-connected continuous signature trajectory, which includes, as a novelty, the pen-ups. The forgery generation imitates a signature by extracting the most perceptually relevant points of the given genuine signature and interpolating them. The capacity to synthesize both static and dynamic signatures using a unique model is evaluated according to its ability to adapt to the static and dynamic signature interand intra-personal variability. Our highly promising results suggest the possibility of using the synthesizer in different areas beyond the generation of unlimited databases for biometric training.	"A handwritten signature is the final response to a com-plex cognitive and neuromuscular process which is the result of the growing up and learning functions. This starts during childhood with lines and scribbles. Later, young children begin to use letters in their own style, although their motor control is usually not very accurate. Tracing helps both to improve their motor control and the learning of the shape and spatial relationships between objects, thus creating the spatial memory or cognitive map. Once this knowledge is acquired and themotor skills begin tomature, it is possible to select an ordered sequence of target points to perform fluent and effortless handwriting. At this stage, the person is ready to define and practice his or her own signature <NO>.
Although signature definition, which is the basis of interpersonal variability, is barely modified, its execution changes continuously due to long and short term factors. The long term drifting is mainly caused by aging whereas short term variability is due to either psychological reasons or external factors such as different stances, writing tools, signing surfaces, or other unaccountable reasons. Modeling these variabilities is a key factor in signature analysis and it is treated differently in several scientific fields.
For instance, automatic signature verification for personal identification <NO>, <NO> looks for features with both inter-personal discriminative ability and intra-personal stability. These features are extracted from either the static signature image or the signature dynamics <NO>, <NO>. Forensic analysis examines the authenticity of inked signatures by careful visual inspection of features such as the caliber, proportion, spacing, progression, pressure, gesture and the area occupied by the signature. This is to detect forgeries and illegitimate changes <NO>.
In the field of health, handwriting can also be applied to the identification of some learning problems for children or early stage degenerative cognitive or motor problems <NO>. In this connection, rapid hand movement velocity profiles made during the handwriting process have been studied in depth <NO>. Such models are currently being used in many applications such as identifying factors responsible for brain strokes <NO>, <NO> and diagnosing and preventing neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s <NO> and Alzheimer’s <NO> among others. Also graphology uses handwriting to estimate, for instance, general personality traits, intelligence, social skills, emotions and social attitudes <NO>.
A common problem for researching in the above areas is the lack of handwritten signature samples. Their collection is costly. Besides, the design of a new database is usually focused on solving a well-defined problem which limits application to other areas. Additionally, legal issues regarding data protection hamper the sharing and distribution of biometric data <NO>.
The generation of synthetic handwritten signature data has emerged to alleviate these drawbacks and to better understand the cognitive and muscular processes involved in handwriting. Synthetic datasets can be used for preliminary algorithm assessment without the economic and time cost of developing real datasets. Additionally, these synthetic data can be shared without legal concerns."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2582167	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	A et al.

Robustness of offline signature verification based on gray level features	['processing is carried out to remove it <NO>.', 'features and Hidden Markov Models (HMM); System B <NO> employs the Boosting Feature Selection (BFS) approach and single grid-based features; System C <NO> is a Support Vector Matching (SVM) classifier with texture features; and System D <NO>, which is a third-party system, uses pose-orientated grid features and an SVM.']	M. A Ferrer, J.F. Vargas, A. Morales, and A. Ordóñez 2012. Robustness of offline signature verification based on gray level features. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security 7,	Several papers have recently appeared in the literature which propose pseudo-dynamic features for automatic static handwritten signature verification based on the use of gray level values from signature stroke pixels. Good results have been obtained using rotation invariant uniform local binary patterns LBP plus LBP and statistical measures from gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) with MCYT and GPDS offline signature corpuses. In these studies the corpuses contain signatures written on a uniform white “nondistorting” background, however the gray level distribution of signature strokes changes when it is written on a complex background, such as a check or an invoice. The aim of this paper is to measure gray level features robustness when it is distorted by a complex background and also to propose more stable features. A set of different checks and invoices with varying background complexity is blended with the MCYT and GPDS signatures. The blending model is based on multiplication. The signature models are trained with genuine signatures on white background and tested with other genuine and forgeries mixed with different backgrounds. Results show that a basic version of local binary patterns (LBP) or local derivative and directional patterns are more robust than rotation invariant uniform LBP or GLCM features to the gray level distortion when using a support vector machine with histogram oriented kernels as a classifier.	"BIOMETRICS is playing an increasingly important role inpersonal identification and authentication systems. Several technologies that have been developed in this area are based on fingerprints, iris, face, voice, the handwritten signature, hand, etc. Handwritten signatures occupy a very special place in this wide set of biometric traits. The main reason is tradition: handwritten signatures have long been established as the most widespread means of personal verification. Signatures are generally accepted by governments and financial institutions as a legal means of verifying identity. Moreover, verification by signature analysis requires no invasive measurements and people are used to this event in their day to day activities A handwritten signature is the result of a complex process depending on the psychophysical state of the signer and the conditions under which the signing process occurs. Although complex theories have been proposed to model the psychophysical mechanisms underlying handwriting and the ink processes, signature verification is still an open challenge since a signature is usually judged to be genuine or a forgery on the basis of only a few reference specimens <NO>. Two methods of signature verification stand out. One is an offline method that uses an optical scanner to obtain handwriting data from a signature written on paper. The other, which is generally more successful, is an online method, which, with a special device, measures the sequential data, such as handwriting speed and pen pressure. Although less successful than the online method, offline systems do have a significant advantage because they do not require access to special processing systems when the signatures are produced <NO>. There are two main approaches for offline signature verification: static approaches and pseudo-dynamic approaches. The static one involves geometric measures of the signature while the pseudo-dynamic one tries to estimate dynamic information from the static image <NO>. Three different approaches in the reconstruction of dynamic information from static handwriting records can be used: mathematical methods, which estimate the temporal order of stroke production; methods inspired by motor control theory, which recover temporal features on the basis of stroke geometries such as curvature; and methods analyzing stroke thickness and stroke intensity variations. Among the techniques that analyze the stroke thickness or stroke intensity variations, we highlight those that focus on the gray level distribution in the signature stroke. Ammar et al. <NO> study the higher pressure points (HPPs) which indicate the regions where more effort has been made by the signer and are located as the darker zones of signature strokes. Mitra et al. in <NO> propose analyzing both higher and lower pressure points. Lv et al. <NO> divide the gray level values into 12 segments between the thresholds to segment the foreground and edge points. The percentage of pixels in each segment is added to the feature vector which also includes a stroke width distribution. Reference <NO> proposes a radial and angular grid for a local rate of higher pressure points numbers versus number of pixels. Franke in <NO> and <NO> identify several ink-trace characteristics affected by the interaction of biomechanical writing and physical ink-deposition

processes. Some authors thus suggest that the selected characteristic can be measured using texture features such as local binary pattern (LBP) which has already been applied in face and hand biometrics <NO>, <NO>. Studies carried out after the initial LBP proposal have allowed the characterization carried out by this operator to improve, e.g., <NO> and <NO>. Specifically, <NO> proposes the use of rotational invariant uniform local binary patterns LBP plus LBP and statistical measures from gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) with theMCYT database and the first 100 signers of GPDS960GraySignature database. The results presented in <NO> are summarized in Table I. An improved version of <NO> that uses the mentioned texture features worked out from the detail matrices of signature wavelet transform was published in <NO>. The major problem LBP has is its sensitivity when noise is present in the signature. Given that gradients are more stable than gray level features, the local derivative pattern (LDerivP) <NO> and local directional pattern (LDP) <NO> have been proposed. These patterns have been applied to face biometrics <NO>. The LDP has also been applied to black and white signatures in <NO> and to gray signatures in <NO>. The previously mentioned developments occurred with databases using signatures from uniform and white backgrounds. It is well known that writing a signature on complex backgrounds changes the gray level distribution of signature strokes. This change suggests that the robustness of pseudo-dynamic features based on gray level should be assessed. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the dependence of the gray level based features <NO> and propose strategies to improve their robustness to gray level distortion and segmentation errors due to complex backgrounds. All of the experimentation presented in this paper has been performed from a biometric point of view, which basically decides whether a signature is authentic or forged. We are aware that it is neither optimally informative nor practical for the forensic handwriting experts (FHEs) to carry out tasks such as detecting disguised signatures <NO> or identifying the author of a forgery <NO>. This paper proposes new methods that improve the automatic verification of signatures retrieved from checks and contributes to closing the gap between biometric state-of-the-art and FHEs requirements. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the signature and check databases, Section III presents the signature preprocessing and Section IV the signature features. Section V describes classifiers design while Section VI shows the experimental methodology, experiments and results.

Persian signature verification based on fractal dimension using testing hypothesis	[]	A. Foroozandeh, Y. Akbari, M.J. Jalili, and J. Sadri 2012. Persian signature verification based on fractal dimension using testing hypothesis. In Int. Conf. on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition	A new approach for verifying off-line Persian signatures is presented, in this paper. In our method, feature extraction step is conducted based on estimated Fractal Dimension (FD) of signatures images, and making decision about acceptance/rejection of test signature is formulated as testing hypothesis which is used for the first time in order to verify offline Persian signatures. The proposed method has been tested on our new created database included 1000 genuine signatures and 200 skilled forgeries which have been collected from a population of 100 human subjects with different educational background. Obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the presented method. Keywords-Off-Line Signature Verification; Fractal Dimension; Testing Hypothesis; Database of Persian Signatures.	"Automatic signature verification (SV) is one of the biometric approaches in person authentication. Compared to other biometrics such as: iris, voice, and fingerprint, the cost of personal verification using his/her signatures is very low. Analysis of signature to authenticate the identity of an individual is conducted through discrimination between genuine signature from a forgery <NO>. Automatic SV has many applications including authenticating bank checks, contracts, and other security documents. SV can be conducted in two ways: on-line, and off-line. So many behavioural information such as: pen-point velocity, tremor information, and writing pressure which can be extracted in on-line SV, are not available in off-line SV and only some signatures signed on some sheets of papers are available in off-line SV. Mentioned restrictions lead to off-line SV be more difficult than on-line. Many attempts have been conducted in both off-line, and on-line SV in Latin language. Two comprehensive surveys of these conducted works have been done by Impedovo et al. <NO>, and Pal et al. <NO>.
During the last decade, some works have been conducted for verifying Persian signatures <NO>. Compared to Latin there are fewer number of works on Persian signatures, so more attention is needed in this field. It should be noted that in spite of Latin signatures which are reshaped of their handwritten names, Persian signatures are usually made of cursive sketches <NO>. Some samples of Persian and Latin signatures have been shown and compared in Figure 1.
Due to above mentioned issues, we decided to focus on off-line Persian SV and proposed a new approach for this target. Our presented approach uses two main concepts: Fractal Dimension (FD) as extracted feature from each signature image, and testing hypothesis used for discrimination between genuine signatures from skilled forgeries. Making decision about acceptance/rejection of signature in question using testing hypothesis yields to obtain more accurate results. Notably statistical tools have been used by some of researches in the process of SV specially in on-line SV systems such as <NO>. Also, there are some similar works in off-line SV such as <NO>. However, based on our searches, presented approach with us has not been proposed in Latin and Persian conducted works, till today. Our presented SV method uses FD values as global features and testing hypothesis as a statistical tool for final decision. The performance of the presented method has been evaluated using our new database. This database includes 1200 Persian signatures which have been signed by 105 writers.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes some background information used in our method. Section 3 describes our presented approach. In Section 4, the experimental results are shown. Finally, our conclusions and future works are presented in Section 5."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2012.254	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	a new approach for verifying off-line persian signatures is presented, in Foroozandeh, et al.

Touchalytics: On the applicability of touchscreen input as a behavioral biometric for continuous authentication	[]	M. Frank, R. Biedert, E. Ma, I. Martinovic, and D. Song 2013. Touchalytics: On the applicability of touchscreen input as a behavioral biometric for continuous authentication. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security 8,	We investigate whether a classifier can continuously authenticate users based on the way they interact with the touchscreen of a smart phone. We propose a set of 30 behavioral touch features that can be extracted from raw touchscreen logs and demonstrate that different users populate distinct subspaces of this feature space. In a systematic experiment designed to test how this behavioral pattern exhibits consistency over time, we collected touch data from users interacting with a smart phone using basic navigation maneuvers, i.e., up–down and left–right scrolling. We propose a classification framework that learns the touch behavior of a user during an enrollment phase and is able to accept or reject the current user by monitoring interaction with the touch screen. The classifier achieves a median equal error rate of 0% for intrasession authentication, 2%–3% for intersession authentication, and below 4% when the authentication test was carried out one week after the enrollment phase. While our experimental findings disqualify this method as a standalone authentication mechanism for long-term authentication, it could be implemented as a means to extend screen-lock time or as a part of a multimodal biometric authentication system.	MOST methods for authenticating users on desktopcomputers or mobile devices define an entry point into the system. Typically, the user faces a password challenge and is granted access only if she inputs the correct password. While such entry-point based methods dominate the authentication schemes today, they have flaws from both usability and security perspectives. From a usability perspective, traditional authentication schemes are inconvenient because users must focus on the authentication step every time they begin interacting with their device. Such inconvenience is amplified under the usage pattern of mobile devices, since they are more frequently accessed, and each use is typically shorter. Authentication with a PIN or secret gesture is too cumbersome for short bursts of activity, such as briefly checking one’s e-mail or reading an SMS. Hence, users often choose simple and weak secrets, increase the screen lock time-outs of their devices, or completely disable unlock <NO>, <NO>. Recent studies have demonstrated how simple attacks such as smudge attacks <NO> can break entry-point authentication schemes. Furthermore, the device cannot detect intruders after the authentication step is performed successfully. Mobile devices are at a higher risk of loss or theft compared to desktop computers <NO>. Continuous or implicit authentication approaches would provide an additional line of defense, designed as a nonintrusive and passive security countermeasure. Such approaches monitor the user’s interaction with the device, and ideally, at every point in time (or at least with a high frequency) the system estimates if the legitimate user is using the device. Hence, a continuous authentication method can either complement entry-point based authentication methods by monitoring the user after a successful login or, if the method satisfies particular accuracy requirements, it could even substitute entry-point based authentication. Although there is a growing body of literature about keystroke dynamics or mouse dynamics for continuous authentication, there is surprisingly little work on continuous authentication for touchscreen devices. The growing popularity of mobile devices—in 2011, more smart phones were sold than desktop PCs and notebooks combined <NO>—increases the value of research on their security mechanisms. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing method for continuous authentication based on touch biometrics (i.e., without requiring a dedicated activity of the user). One reason might be the difficulty of extracting a set of sufficiently discriminative features from touch data, because atomic navigation behavior mostly consists of simple and short movements (see Fig. 1). In this paper, we lay foundational work for continuous authentication schemes that rely on touchscreen input as a data source.We investigate if it is possible to authenticate users while they perform basic navigation steps on a touchscreen device and without any dedicated and explicit security action that requires attention from the user. Our goal is to analyze how robustly such schemes operate and if they are sufficiently reliable to be used on commodity devices. Our contribution is a classification framework that serves as a proof-of-concept for touch-based behavioral biometric authentication. We propose a set of 30 behavioral features that can be extracted from the touch screen input of commodity mobile devices. We designed experiments that let users interact with touchscreens in different sessions and with different tasks, and demonstrate that our features are highly discriminative. Along the way, we discuss design decisions and usage scenarios for such a continuous authenticationmethod. Our study provides insights in the operational modes and scenarios that are permitted given the accuracy of the proposed method. All data collected for this paper is available online.	https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2012.2225048	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Frank, et al.

Online signature verification with support vector machines based on LCSS kernel functions	['Other matching techniques include the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) <NO>, <NO> and the Edit Distance <NO>.']	C. Gruber, T. Gruber, S. Krinninger, and B. Sick 2010. Online signature verification with support vector machines based on LCSS kernel functions. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part B: Cybernetics 40,	In this paper, a new technique for online signature verification or identification is proposed. The technique integrates a longest common subsequences (LCSS) detection algorithm which measures the similarity of signature time series into a kernel function for support vector machines (SVM). LCSS offers the possibility to consider the local variability of signals such as the time series of pen-tip coordinates on a graphic tablet, forces on a pen, or inclination angles of a pen measured during a signing process. Consequently, the similarity of two signature time series can be determined in a more reliable way than with other measures. A proprietary database with signatures of 153 test persons and the SVC 2004 benchmark database are used to show the properties of the new SVM-LCSS. We investigate its parameterization and compare it to SVM with other kernel functions such as dynamic time warping (DTW). Our experiments show that SVM with the LCSS kernel authenticate persons very reliably and with a performance which is significantly better than that of the best comparing technique, SVM with DTW kernel.	"AUTHENTICATION of a person’s identity is a needin many social and commercial interactions. It can be achieved in various ways, for example, using a birth certificate, a passport, or the knowledge of a personal identification number. Very often, signatures are used for authentication. In most cases, a given signature is compared to a single reference signature with the naked eye. Thus, this method is prone to impostors. Electronic image-based techniques (so-called offline signature verification) can also be outsmarted quite easily. However, as authentication by signature is widely accepted compared to other techniques such as fingerprint or iris scan, there is a need for a signature verification technique that ensures a high level of security. Biometric signature verification techniques based on the dynamics of a person’s signature, i.e., time series of pen-tip coordinates, writing forces, or inclination angles of a pen, are, in principle, able to provide a reliable authentication (so-called online signature verification). However, in contrast to many other biometric authentication techniques, signatures of a person may be very variable. This makes the verification process—which can basically be seen as a twoclass classification problem (a given signature belongs to a certain person or not)—quite difficult. Signature verification is closely related to signature identification, where the identity of a person must be determined by comparing a signature sample to all reference samples or models in a database, for instance.
Support vector machines (SVM) are widely used to solve classification and regression problems. As they provide very good results in various pattern recognition fields, they also seem to be a good choice for online signature verification. Compared to other classifier paradigms, such as neural networks, fuzzy classifiers, or decision trees, SVM—which are based on the principle of structural risk minimization—have major advantages, such as a convex objective function with efficient training algorithms and good generalization properties. SVM use kernel functions to measure the similarity of two data objects, in our case, time series. However, standard kernel functions such as Gaussian or polynomial kernels are not well suited for timeseries processing. The key contribution of this paper is the definition of a new kernel function for SVM based on an LCSSs detection for time series that even outperforms kernels based on hidden Markov models (HMM) and dynamic time warping (DTW) in the particular application field. An LCSSbased similarity measure is tailored to deal with the specific variability of online signature data, and it could be used in various online signature verification or identification systems.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: First, we will discuss some specific characteristics of time series that describe the dynamics of handwriting (online signature data) in Section II. In Section III, related work in the application field and in the field of time-series classification with SVM is presented. Section IV describes the new LCSS-based kernel function for online signature verification. In Section V, this method is evaluated in a number of experiments and also compared to other methods. Finally, Section VI summarizes the major findings."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2034382	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Gruber, et al.

Online signature verification and recognition: An approach based on symbolic representation	['There has been much work on online signature verification systems <NO>–<NO>.', 'In addition, Guru and Prakash <NO> derived a symbolic representation of an online signature and introduced the concept of writer independent threshold in order to improve verification accuracy.', 'Some papers <NO>, <NO> randomly select k samples as the training set and then they average over multiple such random selections to derive the final performance result.', 'vector and then employ the classical distance measure such as Euclidean, City-Block for distance computation <NO>, <NO>.', 'Guru and Prakash <NO> represented online signatures by interval-valued symbolic features.']	D.S. Guru, and H.N. Prakash 2009. Online signature verification and recognition: An approach based on symbolic representation. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 31,	In this paper, we propose a new method of representing online signatures by interval-valued symbolic features. Global features of online signatures are used to form an interval-valued feature vectors. Methods for signature verification and recognition based on the symbolic representation are also proposed. We exploit the notions of writer-dependent threshold and introduce the concept of feature-dependent threshold to achieve a significant reduction in equal error rate. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme in discriminating the genuine signatures from the forgeries. We investigate the feasibility of the proposed representation scheme for signature verification and also signature recognition using all 16,500 signatures from 330 individuals of the MCYT bimodal biometric database. Further, extensive experimentations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods by projecting features onto Eigenspace and Fisherspace. Unlike other existing signature verification methods, the proposed method is simple and efficient. The results of the experimentations reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms several other existing verification methods, including the state-of-the-art method for signature verification.	"AN online signature is a behavioral biometric used forpersonal authentication to complete automated transactions, gaining control of computing facilities or physical entry to protected areas. An online signature is more robust compared to an offline signature as it stores dynamic features <NO> like azimuth, elevation, and pressure signals in addition to position trajectories. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that even skilled forgers could imitate online signatures along with their dynamic properties.
Generally, the signature biometric problem has two distinct perspectives: 1) verification and 2) recognition. In verification, features of a test signature are contrasted with features of a limited set of signatures of the class whose identity is claimed, whereas, in recognition, the presence of an identity of a test signature in the database is ascertained. Recognition involves feature-matching stage that extends to entire database.
Online signature verification can generally be divided into two groups: 1) parametric and 2) functional. In a parametric approach, a set of parameters abstracted from the signal represents a signature pattern and the parameters of the reference and test signatures are compared to decide if the test signature is authentic. In this approach, a signature is described compactly so that the enrollment data size is considerably small and constant. More importantly, this method of representation is more stable against the variations in local regions, which are common in signatures. In the literature, we can find hundreds of parameters proposed for signature verification. Several parameters are obtained from time function of the dynamic signals captured by digitizing tablets. Some of the most extensively used parameters are position, displacement, speed, acceleration <NO>, <NO>, number of pen ups and pen downs <NO>, pen down time ratio <NO>, Wavelet transform <NO>, Fourier transform <NO>, and direction-based <NO> parameters. On the other hand, in a function-based approach, the time sequences describing local properties of online signatures are analyzed. In this approach, a signature is characterized by a time function (e.g., position trajectory, velocity, acceleration, pressure, direction of pen movement, and azimuth) <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. In general, function-based systems show better performance than the parameter-based systems but require time-consuming matching/comparison procedures. However, the work <NO> shows that the parametric approaches are equally competitive when compared to function-based approaches.
During matching, the authenticity of a test signature is evaluated by comparing its features against those stored in the knowledgebase. Each matching technique is based on a suitable similarity (or dissimilarity) measure. The matching techniques based on Dynamic time warping (DTW) <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, Support vector machine (SVM) <NO>, <NO>, and Neural Networks (NN) <NO>, <NO>, <NO> are commonly used.
When parameters are used as features, the euclidean <NO>, <NO> distance is the most commonly used dissimilarity measure. When functions are considered, the matching techniques must take into account the variations of signing durations. Elastic matching such as Dynamic Time Warping <NO>, <NO>, <NO> is the best one for this purpose. However, the time complexity of DTW is of Oðn2Þ.
On the other hand, the HMM has also attracted many researchers. An HMM performs stochastic matching of a model and a test signature using a sequence of probability distributions of the features along the signature. This statistical theory of learning has an ability to absorb the variability and similarity between the patterns. The main limitations of HMMs are high computational complexity and large memory requirements. The number of parameters to be set in HMM is more and making a large assumption about the data (regarding transition probabilities and distributions) is required. In addition, large positive data are required to train an HMM.
Another popular matching technique used for signature matching is the SVM. With a set of examples from two classes, an SVM finds the hyperplane that maximizes the distance from either class to the hyperplane and separates the largest number of points belonging to the same class on the same side. Therefore, the misclassification error of data in both the training set and test set is minimized. In <NO>, comparison of SVM classifiers with HMM classifiers in terms of the number of samples used for training and verification using different types of forgeries is carried out. Under both conditions, SVM appears to produce better results. However, the main limitations of SVMs are high algorithmic complexity and extensive memory requirements in large-scale tasks.
Signature verification schemes based on Neural Network are also proposed <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. Although, the neural network-based approaches have the capabilities in generalization, the drawback is the need for a large number of genuine and forgery signatures for training, which is not always practically viable.
There are several other approaches used in signature biometry: the split and merge mechanism <NO>, an elastic local-shape-based model for handwritten curves <NO>, a scheme based on similarity measurement of logarithmic spectrum <NO>, a method for estimating similarity between the input signature and the reference set using string matching <NO>, a relaxation matching technique <NO>, a multiexpert system for signature verification <NO>, a combination of vector quantization and dynamic time warping by means of score fusion <NO>, fusion of function-based methods <NO>, etc.
In this brief survey on signature verification, we understand that almost all works rely on common threshold or global threshold. To the best of our knowledge, the concept of writer-dependent threshold is exploited only in <NO>. Writer-dependent threshold is shown to provide better results than a global threshold. In our work, in addition to adapting writer-dependent threshold, we introduce the concept of feature-dependent threshold for further improvement in results (toward achieving lower equal error rate).
In this work, we propose a simple and novel approach for signature representation based on symbolic data. By the use of the proposed representation and by exploiting the concept of writer-dependent threshold and feature-dependent threshold, we address both the problems of verification and recognition of online signatures. The recent developments in the area of symbolic data analysis have proven that the real-life objects can be better described by the use of symbolic data, which are extensions of classical crisp data <NO>. Symbolic data appear in the form of continuous ratio, discrete absolute interval and multivalued, multivalued with weightage, quantitative, categorical, etc. <NO>. The concept of symbolic data analysis has been extensively studied in the field of cluster analysis <NO>, <NO> and it has been proven both theoretically and experimentally that the clustering approaches based on symbolic data outperform conventional clustering techniques. More details and applications of symbolic data can be found in <NO>. Recently, a symbolic representation model for 2D shapes has been proposed <NO> and it is also shown that symbolic representation effectively captures shape information and the corresponding retrieval methodology outperforms conventional representation techniques <NO>. In signature representation, since sample signatures of each person possess significant variations, features extracted from such samples too vary considerably. Therefore, we felt that it would be more meaningful to capture these variations in the form of interval-valued features and provide an effective representation for signatures. To the best of our knowledge, no work has been reported in the literature which uses symbolic representation for signatures. With this backdrop, in our previous work <NO>, we made an initial attempt toward application of symbolic data concepts for signature verification. In this paper, the same work is extended in many directions. By exploiting the concept of feature-dependent threshold and writer-dependent thresholds, we have obtained significant reduction in equal error rate. Further, the proposed approach is simple and easy to realize. Overall, the following are the contributions of this work:
. a new method of symbolic representation for online signatures; . methods for signature verification and recognition, based on a novel similarity measure; . exploitation of the concept of writer-dependent threshold; . introduction of feature-dependent threshold; . conduction of extensive experiments for both verification and recognition on a large database of 16,500 signatures of 330 individuals (MCYT_ signature database); . achieving a remarkable reduction in EER when compared to the best contemporary works.
All in all, the proposed model being a stand-alone and first of its kind in the literature of signature verification/ recognition is expected to open up a new dimension for further research in the field of signature biometrics by the use of symbolic data.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, the proposed method of symbolic representation, verification, and recognition of online signatures are presented. In Section 3, the details of the signature verification and recognition experimentations along with results are summarized. A comparative study is presented in Section 4. In Section 5, the proposed approaches of signature verification
and recognition are applied on the features projected onto Eigenspace and Fisherspace. Finally, Section 6 follows with conclusions."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.302	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Guru, et al.

Fiberio: A touchscreen that senses fingerprints	[]	C. Holz, and P. Baudisch 2013. Fiberio: A touchscreen that senses fingerprints. In Proc. 26th Annual ACM Symp. on User Interface Software and Technology	We present Fiberio, a rear-projected multitouch table that identifies users biometrically based on their fingerprints during each touch interaction. Fiberio accomplishes this using a new type of screen material: a large fiber optic plate. The plate diffuses light on transmission, thereby allowing it to act as projection surface. At the same time, the plate reflects light specularly, which produces the contrast required for fingerprint sensing. In addition to offering all the functionality known from traditional diffused illumination systems, Fiberio is the first interactive tabletop system that authenticates users during touch interaction—unobtrusively and securely using the biometric features of fingerprints, which eliminates the need for users to carry any identification tokens. Author	"Several researchers have proposed techniques that allow interactive tabletop systems to distinguish users during interaction. The ability to associate each touch with a particular user has allowed such systems to personalize interaction <NO>, log user activity <NO>, and ensure that only the authorized users can access private objects <NO> or perform privileged activities <NO>. 
 A number of existing approaches address this challenge. Unfortunately, they either require users to carry identification tokens, such as RFID tags <NO>, rings <NO>, or marker gloves <NO> or they can only distinguish among a small group of users, for example by recognizing their shoes <NO>, their hand contours <NO>, or the chairs they sit in <NO>. 
 Researchers have therefore pointed to fingerprint recognition as a possible solution to the problem. Fingerprint-based authentication is secure <NO> and—in conjunction with touch interaction—would be unobtrusive for users. First steps in this direction include a separate fingerprint scanner placed next to the touchscreen <NO> and an interactive fingerprint scanner without a screen (Ridgepad <NO>). These prototypes point out the challenge in designing such a system, i.e., to sense fingerprints and display a computergenerated image in the same space at the same time. This challenge boils down to two contradicting requirements with respect to the screen material. On the one hand, the screen has to reveal fingerprints, i.e., produce contrast between the ridges and valleys of the fingerprint. Known solutions require a specular screen surface to accomplish optical fingerprint scanning. On the other hand, to be used as a display, the screen has to allow the rear-projection to produce a visible image, which requires the screen material to be diffuse. Unfortunately, specular and diffuse are contradictory requirements for such a surface. These contradictory requirements eliminate a number of candidate technologies that appear suitable at first glance. Tabletops based on frustrated total internal reflection <NO>, for example, cannot generate the contrast between fingerprint valleys and ridges and thus do not afford scanning users’ fingerprints with sufficient quality. In this paper, we demonstrate how to resolve this contradiction. We present Fiberio, a multitouch table that recognizes fingerprints during touch interaction. As shown in Figure 1, Fiberio authenticates users while interacting with the table."	https://doi.org/10.1145/2501988.2502021	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Holz, et al.

On-line signature verification using 1-D velocity-based directional analysis	[]	M.T. Ibrahim, M. Kyan, M.A. Khan, and L. Guan 2010. On-line signature verification using 1-D velocity-based directional analysis. In 20th International Conference on Pattern Recognition	In this paper, we propose a novel approach for identity verification based on the directional analysis of velocity-based partitions of an on-line signature. First, interfeature dependencies in a signature are exploited by decomposing the shape (horizontal trajectory, vertical trajectory) into two partitions based on the velocity profile of the base-signature for each signer, which offers the flexibility of analyzing both low and high-curvature portions of the trajectory independently. Further, these velocity-based shape partitions are analyzed directionally on the basis of relative angles. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then used to find the decision boundary between the genuine and forgery class. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in on-line signature verification in comparison with other techniques. Keywords-on-line signature; inter-feature dependencies; curvature; support vector machine;	"On-line Signature Verification is a process of verifying user’s identity on the basis of signature’s shape along with some dynamic features such as velocity, acceleration, curvature, pressure, total signature time, RMS speed, average writing speed etc <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. In the past, it has been observed that the on-line signature verification based on a composite feature set containing both shape and dynamic features (velocity, pressure and angle) can outperform verification systems based on the shape alone <NO>, <NO>, <NO>.
This paper also proposes a composite feature set based upon the velocity-based directional analysis of an on-line signature. Recently, a 16-band Decimation-Free Directional Filter Bank (DDFB) was used for the same purpose <NO>. But there are two major problems with the DDFB-based system. The first problem with the DDFB-based system, is that it takes the image as an input. In <NO>, spatial areas corresponding to velocity-based partitions were converted into gray-scale images, due to which, the information of each independent trajectory was lost. The second problem with DDFB or with any filter bank is the selection of the order of the filter. As we know, the more we increase the order of the filter, the more we will get artifacts in the output of the filter. In case of signature, these artifacts can lead to non-existing spatial areas which reduces the verification performance. So, there is a need for a directional analysis tool which can perform the directional analysis in the same manner as DDFB does, but without converting the on-line signature into an image and without any constraint on the order of the filter. In this paper, we provide a novel approach for the directional analysis of a signature based on velocity partitions which first decompose the shape (horizontal and vertical trajectories) of the signature into two velocitybased partitions for analyzing the high-curvature and lowcurvature portions of the trajectory independently. Following this, the low and high-curvature segments are split into two relative angle based partitions respectively. In this work, our proposed directional analysis tool does not need to convert the signature trajectories into an image. Also one can have ideal partitions of signature based on its relative angles - the details of which are deferred to Section III-A.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the second section deals with the acquisition of signature data and preprocessing steps; the third section is dedicated to the design and structure of our proposed system; the experimental results and concluding remarks are presented in the final section of this paper."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2010.933	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Ibrahim, et al.

IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 38,	In recent years, along with the extraordinary diffusion of the Internet and a growing need for personal verification in many daily applications, automatic signature verification is being considered with renewed interest.

It includes a comprehensive bibliography of more than 300 selected references as an aid for researchers working in the field.	"THE SECURITY requirements of the today’s society haveplaced biometrics at the center of a large debate, as it is becoming a key aspect in a multitude of applications <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. The term biometrics refers to individual recognition based on a person’s distinguishing characteristics. While other techniques use the possession of a token (i.e., badge, ID card, etc.) or the knowledge of something (i.e., a password, key phase, etc.) to perform personal recognition, biometric techniques offer the potential to use the inherent characteristics of the person to be recognized to perform this task. Thus, biometric attributes do not suffer from the disadvantages of either the token-based approaches, whose attributes can be lost or stolen, and knowledge-based approaches, whose attributes can be forgotten <NO>, <NO>.
A biometric system can either verify or identify. In verification mode, it authenticates the person’s identity on the basis of his/her claimed identity. Instead, in identification mode, it establishes the person’s identity (among those enrolled in a database) without the subjects having to claim their identity <NO>, <NO>. Depending on the personal traits considered, two types of biometrics can be defined: physiological or behavioral. The former are based on the measurement of biological traits of users, like, for instance, fingerprint, face, hand geometry, retina, and iris. The latter consider behavioral traits of users, such as voice or handwritten signature <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>.
The assessment of biometrics is a multifaceted problem <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. For instance, a biometric trait should be universal,

i.e., each person should possess the trait; unique, i.e., no two persons should share the same trait; permanent, i.e., the trait should neither change nor be alterable; collectable, i.e., the trait can be obtained easily. In addition, biometric system design should also address other desirable features such as accuracy, cost and speed effectiveness, acceptability by the users, and so on <NO>, <NO>.
Although a wide set of biometrics has been considered so far, it is worth noting that no trait is able to completely satisfy all the desirable characteristics required for a biometric system <NO>. Thus, the assessment of a biometric trait is strongly dependent on the specific application since it involves not only technical issues but also social and cultural aspects <NO>, <NO>, <NO>.
Handwritten signatures occupy a very special place in this wide set of biometric traits <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. This is mainly due to the fact that handwritten signatures have long been established as the most widespread means of personal verification. Signatures are generally recognized as a legal means of verifying an individual’s identity by administrative and financial institutions <NO>, <NO>. Moreover, verification by signature analysis requires no invasive measurements and people are familiar with the use of signatures in their daily life <NO>.
Unfortunately, a handwritten signature is the result of a complex process depending on the psychophysical state of the signer and the conditions under which the signature apposition process occurs. Therefore, although complex theories have been proposed to model the psychophysical mechanisms underlying handwriting <NO>–<NO> and the ink-depository processes <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, signature verification still remains an open challenge since a signature is judged to be genuine or a forgery only on the basis of a few reference specimens <NO>. Fig. 1 sketches the three main phases of automatic signature verification: data acquisition and preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. During enrolment phase, the input signatures are processed and their personal features are extracted and stored into the knowledge base. During the classification phase, personal features extracted from an inputted signature are compared

against the information in the knowledge base, in order to judge the authenticity of the inputted signature.
Automatic signature verification involves aspects from disciplines ranging from human anatomy to engineering, from neuroscience to computer science and system science <NO>. Because of this fact, in recent years, studies on signature verification have attracted researchers from different fields, working for universities and companies, which are interested in not only the scientific challenges but also the valuable applications this field offers <NO>. Comprehensive survey papers reported the progress in the field of automatic signature verification until 1993 <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. In 1994, a special issue and a book collecting the most relevant research activities were published <NO>. Successively, various papers have summarized the increasing research efforts in the field <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO> also with respect to the more general area of handwriting analysis and processing <NO>.
In conjunction with the recent and extraordinary growth of the Internet, automatic signature verification is being considered with new interest. The creation of specific laws and regulations, which have been approved in many countries <NO>, <NO>, and the attention that several national associations and international institutes have given to the standardization of signature data interchange formats <NO>, <NO>, <NO> are evidence of the renewed attention in this field. The aim of these efforts is to facilitate the integration of signature verification technologies into other standard equipment to form complete solutions for a wide range of commercial applications such as banking, insurance, health care, ID security, document management, e-commerce, and retail point-of-sale (POS) <NO>, <NO>, <NO>.
This paper presents the state of the art in automatic signature verification, with specific attention to the most recent advancements. Following an introduction of the phases of the signature verification process, the main contributions of research activities in recent years are described and the most promising trends are discussed. Specifically, Section II presents the main aspects related to data acquisition and preprocessing and Section III discusses the feature extraction phase. Section IV describes research activities concerning the classification phase while Section V summarizes the performance of systems for automatic signature verification reported in the literature.

On-line signature verification by stroke-dependent representation domains	[]	D. Impedovo, and G. Pirlo 2010. On-line signature verification by stroke-dependent representation domains. In 12th Int. Conf. on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition	In this paper a new system for dynamic signature verification is presented. It is based on the consideration that each region of an handwritten signature can convey personal characteristics in diverse domains. Therefore, a multi-expert approach is considered in which each stroke of the signature is evaluated in the most profitable domain of representation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	"Biometry offers potentials for verifying the identity of a subject by the analysis of physical and behavioural characteristics. Physical characteristics can be obtained from finger-print, palm-print, face gestures, retina, or DNA. Behavioural characteristics can be obtained from key-stroke dynamics, speech, hand-written signature. Among others, hand-written signature is one of the most interesting means for automated personal verification. Signature is the customary way of identifying an individual in our society and it is well-accepted by every user for legal attestation and administrative certification <NO>. In addition, along with the growth of the internet, automatic signature verification is being considered with new interest. The creation of specific laws and regulations, which have been approved in many countries <NO>, and the attention that several national associations and international institutes have given to the standardization of signature data interchange formats <NO> are evidence of the renewed attention in this field. The aim of these efforts is to facilitate the integration of signature verification technologies into other standard equipment to form complete solutions for a wide range of commercial applications such as banking, insurance, health care, ID-security, document management, ecommerce and retail point-of-sale (POS) <NO>.
Unfortunately, handwritten signatures are very complex biometric traits since they are the result of a complex process based on a sequence of predetermined actions, stored in the human brain, and realised by the writing systems of the signers (arms and hands) through ballisticlike movements. Therefore, also signatures written by the same person can be very different depending on the physical and psychological state of the writer. Thus, automatic
signature verification involves aspects from a wide range of disciplines, as computer science, engineering, psychology, neuroscience, human anatomy and system science and several comprehensive survey papers reporting the development of the field have been published <NO>. In order to face with the enormous variability of signatures, multi-expert approach has been often considered and several systems have been proposed in the literature which combine verifiers based on different sets of features, using parallel <NO>, serial <NO> or hybrid <NO> strategies.
This paper presents a multi-expert system for dynamic signature verification. The system uses a segmentation technique of hand-written signatures well-suited for multiexpert verification since it provides compatible strokeoriented descriptions of the test and the reference signatures. Successively, the most profitable domain of representation of each stroke is determined on the basis of its stability characteristics. In other words, each stroke is verified in the domain of representation (i.e. displacement, velocity, acceleration, pressure, direction of pen movement, etc.) in which it is more stable. In this domain, in fact, it is expected that verification is more accurate than in other domains in which the signer is highly variable. The final decision is obtained by simple or weighted averaging of the local decisions on the authenticity of each individual stroke. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the multi-expert process of signature verification. Section 3 presents the segmentation technique. The selection of the best domain of representation for each stroke and the process of stroke verification is described in Section 4. Section 5 presents the process of decision combination. The experimental results are presented in Section 6."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2010.102	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Impedovo, et al.

Handwritten signature verification: New advancements and open issues	['fested in many publications and surveys <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO> published in the literature during previous decades.']	D. Impedovo, G. Pirlo, and R. Plamondon 2012. Handwritten signature verification: New advancements and open issues. In Int. Conf. on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition	Recently, research in handwritten signature verification has been considered with renewed interest. In fact, in the age of e-society, handwritten signature still represents an extraordinary means for personal verification and the possibility of using automatic signature verification in a range of applications is becoming a reality. This paper focuses on some of the most remarkable aspects the field and highlights some recent research directions. A list of selected publications is also provided for interested researchers. KeywordsBiometry, Handwritten Signature Verification, Security.	"The recent years have been characterized by the growing interest toward personal identity authentication, along with the spreading of the internet and the increased demand for security issues. Biometrics is an important field that allows personal identity authentication through the analysis of personal characteristics. Two types of biometrics means can be considered: Physiological biometrics, which involves data derived from the direct measurement of some part of the human body; Behavioural biometrics, which involves data derived from an action taken by a person. Examples of physiological biometrics include fingerprint-, face-, palmprint-, retina-based verification. Examples of behavioral biometrics are speech-, keystroke dynamics- and signaturebased verification <NO>.
Among the others, handwritten signature is one of the most widespread means for personal authentication. In all developed countries, people learn to affix the signature in the early age and practiced over a period of years. So handwritten signature is a very personal pattern that originates from a complex generation process involving the instantiation of an action plan stored in the brain of the signer and its execution by his/her body (arm, hand) using suitable writing devices (pen, pencil, paper, etc.) <NO>.
Therefore, it is not surprising that signature analysis is an extremely complex problem that involves aspects of diverse disciplines. Four comprehensive surveys that report the progress in the field of automatic signature verification respectively up to 1989, 1993, 2000 and 2008, provide a comprehensive overview of the efforts done in this research area <NO>.
The aim of this paper is to highlight some of the most relevant issues at the frontier of research in the field of automatic signature verification. Throughout the paper, some of the most promising directions of research will be pointed out and discussed.
The organization of the paper is the following. Section 2 presents some aspects related to signature acquisition and with the use of new acquisition devices. Some of the crucial questions about signature modelling and representation are discussed in Section 3. The verification strategies are illustrated in Section 4. Section 5 introduce the problem of the assessment of signature verification systems. Some crosscultural and health issues are presented in Section 6.

Combination of signature verification techniques by SVM	[]	T. Ito, W. Ohyama, T. Wakabayashi, and F. Kimura 2012. Combination of signature verification techniques by SVM. In 13th Int. Conf. on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR’12)	This paper proposes a new SVM based technique for combining signature verification techniques using off-line features and on-line features. The off-line feature based technique employs gradient feature vector representing the shape of signature image, and the on-line feature based technique employs dynamic programming (DP) matching technique for time series data of the signatures. The final decision (verification) is performed by SVM based on output from those off-line and online techniques. In the evaluation test the proposed technique achieved 92.96% verification accuracy, which is 1.4% higher than the better accuracy obtained by the individual techniques. This result shows that combining multiple techniques by SVM improves signature verification accuracy significantly. Keywords-signature verification; gradient feature; HOG; SVM; DP;	"Automatic signature verification, a behavioral biometrics, has been studied by many researchers<NO>. It can be performed using the scanned signature image or using a tablet with a stylus. The former is called off-line verification and the later is called on-line verification. On-line verification with the availability of dynamic information such as stroke order, velocity, or local pressure has already had commercial applications.
Most of the techniques for the on-line signature verification are based on waveform analysis of time series data in terms of Dynamic Programming (DP) or Hidden Markov Model (HMM) <NO>. However the problems such as accuracy improvement and reduction of required size for training sample are still remaining as the research topics．In particular, the shape of signature image (offline features) is not directly employed for its verification while on-line features are focused on. The characteristic of an individual’s signature can only be established using an appropriate number of signature specimens. Since human signature could vary overtime, too few samples will increase the false rejection rate of genuine signatures while too many samples will be labor intensive for the user.
Aiming to solve these problems this paper proposes a new SVM based technique for combining signature verification techniques using off-line features and on-line features.
The off-line feature based technique employs gradient feature vector representing the shape of signature image<NO>, and the on-line feature based technique employs dynamic programming (DP) matching technique for time series data of the signatures. By combining those two techniques, it is possible to verify the signature synthetically using both offline and on-line features. The proposed technique can be applied to combine more techniques with other features to achieve higher performance.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the signature verification techniques based on the gradient features (2.1), DP matching (2.2) and the combining technique by SVM (2.3). Section 3 details the experimental settings, results and discussions.

Similarity computation based on feature extraction for off-line Chinese signature verification	[]	J. Ji, Z.D. Lu, and X. Chen 2009. Similarity computation based on feature extraction for off-line Chinese signature verification. In 6th Int. Conf. on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery,	In this paper we present a new method for off-line Chinese signature verification. The approach is based on feature extraction of every segment segmented from the signature image. After preprocessed and segmented, the signature image is segmented to some segments. Every segment is represented by a set of seven features. By using these segments and its features, the degree of similarity between the questioned sample and the n genuine signature samples is computed. Only a little number (3 to 5) of genuine samples for each writer is needed by using a simplified version of question document expert’s classifier. Experimental results show our approach is promising to distinguish random and simple forgeries from genuine signatures effectively.	"As one of the personal verification in our daily life, signature verification has many metrics, such that signatures are easy to be acquired; the verification is non-intrusive and is widely accepted by people. Therefore signature verification plays an important role in the personal verification field and attracts more and more researchers to work in this field <NO>.
Two-classes of signature verification system are usually distinguished: on-line system for which signature data are captured during the writing process, which makes available the static features and the dynamic features like velocity, acceleration and pressure etc, and off-line system for which signature data takes place on a static image captured once the writing process is over, which only makes available the static features <NO>.
Many approaches are used for solving the involved automatic off-line signature verification problems <NO>. In general, the proposed techniques use either a type of features (global, local, statistical, geometric, pseudo dynamic etc), or a combination of different types of features <NO>, which extracted from the signature images.
A simple and efficient approach is introduced that can be applied to off-line Chinese signature verification. The approach is based on feature extraction of segment of the signature skeleton and the analysis of the matching between two compared signatures’ skeletons. Each extracted segment is represented by three sets of features. In the first set of features, there are two features: its horizontal and vertical center of the segment. Secondly, the number of points that have four kinds of directions neighbors is counted. Lastly, the relative grays of the segment. This information is efficiently compared with the corresponding patterns stored in the signature reference database using the method introduced in ref. <NO>. The degree of similarity between the test sample and the n genuine samples stored in the signature reference database is computed."	https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2009.597	2	['sample']	['signature_identification', 'chain_code', 'code_direction', 'modified_chain', 'line_signatures']	['chain_code_direction', 'modified_chain_code', 'segmented_signature_image', 'signature_identification_proposed', 'line_signature_verification']	Ji, et al.

Glove-based approach to online signature verification	[]	N.S. Kamel, S. Sayeed, and G.A. Ellis 2008. Glove-based approach to online signature verification. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 30,	Utilizing the multiple degrees of freedom offered by the data glove for each finger and the hand, a novel online signature verification system using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) numerical tool for signature classification and verification is presented. The proposed technique is based on the Singular Value Decomposition in finding r singular vectors sensing the maximal energy of glove data matrixA, called principal subspace, so the effective dimensionality ofA can be reduced. Having modeled the data glove signature through its r-principal subspace, signature authentication is performed by finding the angles between the different subspaces. A demonstration of the data glove is presented as an effective highbandwidth data entry device for signature verification. This SVD-based signature verification technique is tested and its performance is shown to be able to produce Equal Error Rate (EER) of less than 2.37 percent.	"SIGNATURE verification can be split into two categories: Static or offline: In this mode, users write their signature on paper, digitize it through an optical scanner or comer, and a biometric system recognizes the signature by analyzing its shape. Dynamic or online: In this mode, users write their signature on a digitizing tablet, smart pen, or pen tablet. Considering the highest security levels required by the online systems (dynamic), most of the efforts of the researchers in this field address this group.
The design of a dynamic signature verification system initially involves the following four aspects:
1. data acquisition and preprocessing (input device), 2. feature extraction, 3. matching (classification), and 4. decision making.
Fig. 1 shows the general online signature verification process. Although successful in resisting attempts by imposters, the Dynamic Signature Verification (DSV) system still faces serious challenges for various reasons. The large variation in the execution speed of various phases of a signature is one such reason. Another reason is the quality and positions of the physical properties describing the signature themselves. Other factors affecting the difficulty of DSV are the emotional state of the signing person and the accuracy of the input device used. For successful implementation,
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the details of the proposed SVD-based signature verification technique. Section 3 shows experimental results including the selection of the system parameters and a comparison with other online techniques. Section 4 concludes the paper.

Online signature verification based on biometric features	[]	N. Li, J. Liu, Q. Li, X. Luo, and J. Duan 2016. Online signature verification based on biometric features. In 49th Hawaii Int. Conf. on System Sciences	Since current signatures are generally not verified carefully, frauds by forging others signature always happen. This paper tried to authenticate user automatically with electronic signatures on mobile device. We collected coordinates, pressure, contact area and other biometric data when users sign their name on touch screen smart phone. Then we used four different classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost and Random Forest to build a specific signature verification model for each user, and compared the verification accuracy of these algorithms. The experimental result on 42 persons’ dataset shows that these four algorithms have satisfactory performance on Chinese signature verification, and Adaboost has the best performance with error rate of 2.375%. Keywords-Electronic Signature; Signature Verification; Adaboost; Random Forest;	"With the continuous advance of the paperless office, electronic signatures are gradually replacing handwritten signatures in various fields. The most beneficial reason for electronic signatures taking place of handwritten signatures is resource saving. To get electronic signatures, users are required to sign his/her name on the touch screen of a digital panel, a tablet or a smart phone rather than on paper. For those companies that have a large requirement for receipts or contracts, electronic signatures can help them reduce considerable expenditure. Nowadays, many communications, retailing, hotels and many other serviceoriented industries are beginning to use electronic signature to authenticate user or produce non-repudiation evidence. Especially in financial industries such as banks and insurance which are in greater demand for signatures, electronic signatures are widely adopted in China. So if the reliability of electronic signatures can be guaranteed, more companies and industries are willing to use electronic signatures instead of handwritten ones.
In terms of security, electronic signatures have better reliability than handwritten signatures. Generally handwritten signatures are highly vulnerable to imitate. People have to authenticate handwritten signatures by hand, and it is neither reliable nor efficient because of judges background knowledge and limited experience. Even if we can turn

the handwritten signature to an image and authenticate it automatically, it is unreliable. Because offline-handwritten signatures contain no information of writing process, we can only authenticate it by computing the similarity of shape and structure. As for electronic signatures, we could collect more information with touchscreen besides shape and structure of characters, such as writing speed, pressure, size of contact area and other biometric features. These biometric features can be used to reproduce the writing process and often reflect users writing habits. Since each person has unique writing habit and it is hard to imitate, signature verification based on biometric features is feasible.
This paper explored the feasibility of automatic signature identification on a smart device to tell whether the signer is the real user. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first briefly describe the related work in Section 2. The design details for our signature verification experiment are presented in Section 3.

Signature verification competition for online and offline skilled forgeries (SigComp2011)	[]	M. Liwicki, M. Imran Malik, C.E. van den Heuvel, X. Chen, C. Berger, R. Stoel, M. Blumenstein, and B. Found 2011. Signature verification competition for online and offline skilled forgeries (SigComp2011). In 11th Int. Conf. on Document Analysis and Recognition	The Netherlands Forensic Institute and the Institute for Forensic Science in Shanghai are in search of a signature verification system that can be implemented in forensic casework and research to objectify results. We want to bridge the gap between recent technological developments and forensic casework. In collaboration with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence we have organized a signature verification competition on datasets with two scripts (Dutch and Chinese) in which we asked to compare questioned signatures against a set of reference signatures. We have received 12 systems from 5 institutes and performed experiments on online and offline Dutch and Chinese signatures. For evaluation, we applied methods used by Forensic Handwriting Examiners (FHEs) to assess the value of the evidence, i.e., we took the likelihood ratios more into account than in previous competitions. The data set was quite challenging and the results are very interesting.	"The topic of writer identification and verification has been addressed in the literature for several decades <NO>, <NO>. Usually, the task is to identify the writer of a handwritten text or signature or to verify his or her identity. Work in writer verification can be differentiated according to the available data. If only a scanned or a camera captured image of the handwriting is available then writer classification is performed with offline data. Otherwise, if temporal and spatial information about the writing is available, writer classification is performed with online data. Usually, the former task is considered to be less difficult than the offline classification <NO>. Surveys covering work in automatic writer identification and signature verification until 1993 are given in <NO>. Subsequent works up to 2000 are summarized in <NO>. Most approaches are tested on specially collected data sets which were acquired in controlled environments.

• BioSecure Signature Evaluation Campaign 2009, online
data, 5 reference signatures
• SigComp 2009 <NO>, online and offline data, 1 reference signature
Most of the current research in the field of signature verification does not take the real needs of Forensic Handwriting Experts (FHEs) into account. In their casework they often work with signatures produced in various real world environments. These signatures are more difficult to analyze compared to the signatures produced in controlled environments. FHEs also have to deal with possibly disguised signatures, where the author tries to disguise his or her handwriting in order to make it seem to be a forgery. The 4NSigComp2010 <NO> was the first signature verification competition focusing explicitly the classification of disguised, simulated and genuine signatures.
We have now organized the Signature Verification Competition for Online and Offline Skilled Forgeries (SigComp2011). The major emphasis of this competition is not the possibility of disguised signatures but to motivate the signature verification community to enable their systems to compute the likelihood ratios instead of just computing the evidence (for more details see <NO>). This is very important as it allows one to combine the FHE’s evidence (from the results of an automated system) with other evidence presented in a court of law. In this competition we ask to produce a comparison score (e.g. a degree of similarity or difference), and the evidential value of that score, expressed as the ratio of the probabilities of finding that score when the questioned signature is a genuine signature and when it is a forgery (i.e. the likelihood ratio). Note that this competition has introduced a paradigm shift from the “decision paradigm” to an evidential value that impacts the task in the competition.
 The issue is not the pure classification, since 
• The FHE cannot and was never asked to decide on authorship,
• the FHE cannot know the probability of authorship based on handwriting comparison alone, and
• classification brings with it the probability of an error of which the cost is undefined.
The true issue is to find the likelihood ratio (LR) for a comparison: the probability of finding a particular score given that Hypothesis H1 is true, divided by the probability of finding the score when the alternative Hypothesis H2 is true. H1 corresponds to intra-source scores (same author) and H2 to inter-source scores (different authors).
The relevant graphs therefore show histograms of some measure of similarity (or difference; or any continuous measure that used to be compared to some threshold in a classification task) for intra-source and inter-source comparisons. Such graphs make it possible to assess the value of the evidence given both hypotheses, which is of major importance to forensic experts and the courts. Therefore, in this competition we have had a closer look at the likelihood ratios."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2011.294	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Liwicki, et al.

Maiorana, P. Campisi, J. Fierrez, J. Ortega-Garcia, and A. Neri 2010. Cancelable templates for sequence-based biometrics with application to on-line signature recognition. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part A: Systems and Humans 40,	Recent years have seen the rapid spread of biometric technologies for automatic people recognition. However, security and privacy issues still represent the main obstacles for the deployment of biometric-based authentication systems. In this paper, we propose an approach, which we refer to as BioConvolving, that is able to guarantee security and renewability to biometric templates. Specifically, we introduce a set of noninvertible transformations, which can be applied to any biometrics whose template can be represented by a set of sequences, in order to generate multiple transformed versions of the template. Once the transformation is performed, retrieving the original data from the transformed template is computationally as hard as random guessing. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach is applied to an on-line signature recognition system, where a hidden Markov model-based matching strategy is employed. The performance of a protected on-line signature recognition system employing the proposed BioConvolving approach is evaluated, both in terms of authentication rates and renewability capacity, using the MCYT signature database. The reported extensive set of experiments shows that protected and renewable biometric templates can be properly generated and used for recognition, at the expense of a slight degradation in authentication performance.	"BIOMETRIC person recognition refers to the use of phys-iological or behavioral characteristics of people in an automated way to identify them or verify who they claim to be <NO>. Biometric recognition systems are typically able to provide improved comfort and security to their users, when compared to traditional authentication methods, typically based on something that you have (e.g., a token) or something that you know (e.g., a password).
Unfortunately, biometrics-based people authentication poses new challenges related to personal data protection, not existing in traditional authentication methods. In fact, if biometric data are stolen by an attacker, this can lead to identity theft. Moreover, users’ biometrics cannot be changed, and they may reveal sensitive information about personality and health, which can be processed and distributed without the users’ authorization <NO>. An unauthorized tracking of the enrolled subjects can also be done when a cross-matching among different biometric databases is performed, since personal biometric traits are permanently associated with the users. This would lead to users’ privacy loss.
Because of these security and privacy issues, there are currently many research efforts toward protecting biometric systems against possible attacks which can be perpetrated at their vulnerable points (see <NO>). In essence, the adopted security measures should be able to enhance biometric systems’ resilience against attacks while allowing the matching to be performed efficiently, thus guaranteeing acceptable recognition performance.
In this paper, we introduce a novel noninvertible transformbased approach, namely, BioConvolving, which provides both protection and renewability for any biometric template which can be expressed in terms of a set of discrete sequences related to the temporal, spatial, or spectral behavior of the considered biometrics. The proposed approach can be therefore applied to a variety of biometric modalities, for example, speech biometrics <NO>, where spectral or temporal analysis of the voice signal produces discrete sequences, or to signature <NO> and handwriting <NO> recognition, where the extracted sequences are related to the pen’s position, applied pressure, and inclination. Moreover, when performing gait recognition <NO>, temporal sequences describing the trajectories of the ankle, knee, and hip of walking people can be considered as templates. A set of discrete finite sequences representing the potentials of brain electrical activity, generated as a response to visual stimuli, can also be employed as a template, when performing brain-activity-based identification <NO>. This is also the case when performing iris recognition, since the normalized template can be decomposed into 1-D intensity signals, which retain the local variations of the iris <NO>.
It is worth pointing out that some methods for the protection of templates extracted from the aforementioned biometrics act on sets of parametric features derived from the originally acquired data, thus limiting the kind of matching which can be performed <NO>. Since our BioConvolving approach deals with discrete sequences instead of parametric features, it allows using sophisticated matching schemes such as dynamic time warping (DTW) or hidden Markov models (HMMs). As a proof of concept, we apply the proposed BioConvolving protection scheme to signature biometrics, extending the authors’ works presented in <NO> and <NO>. Specifically, the signature representation here employed comprises a higher number of signature sequences, and a detailed renewability and security analysis is carried out.
Specifically, this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the different solutions which have been investigated in the recent past to secure biometric templates are analyzed. The proposed approach for the protection of sequence-based biometric templates is illustrated in Section III, and its security analysis is outlined in Section IV. The state of the art on signature-based authentication schemes and on signature template protection approaches is outlined in Section V. The application of the proposed scheme to on-line signature biometrics is presented in Section VI, which details both the employed signature representation and the employed template matcher. The experimental setup is described in Section VII. The authentication and the renewability performances of the proposed protection approach are discussed in Sections VIII and IX, respectively. Eventually, some conclusions are drawn in Section X."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2041653	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Maiorana, et al.

A signature verification framework for digital pen applications	[]	M.I. Malik, S. Ahmed, A. Dengel, and M. Liwicki 2012. A signature verification framework for digital pen applications. In 10th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems (DAS’12)	In this paper we present a framework for realtime online signature verification scenarios. The proposed framework is based on state-of-the-art feature extraction and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classification. While our signature verification library is generally applicable to any input device using digital pens, we have implemented verification scenarios using the Anoto digital pen. As such our automated signature verification framework becomes an interesting commodity for industry, because the Anoto SDK is easy to apply and the GMM-based classification can be seamlessly integrated. The novelty of this work is the application of our framework that takes real-time online signature verification to every scenario where digital pens may potentially be used. In this paper we describe several scenarios where our framework has been applied, including signatures in financial contracts or ordering processes. We also propose a general approach to integrate the GMM-descriptions into electronic ID-cards in order to also store behavioral biometrics on these cards. In experiments we have measured the performance of the signature verification system when skilled forgeries were present. The interest shown by our partner financial institutions and the results of our initial evaluations indicate that our signature verification framework suits exactly the demands of our clients. Keywords-Online signatures, Verification, Biometric authentication, Mixture models, Anoto, Digital pens, Forged signatures, Skilled forgeries, Handwriting analysis	"Automated signature verification is in focus of research since decades. In many recent works automatic signature verification is described as a two-class pattern classification problem <NO>. Here an automated system has to decide whether or not a given signature belongs to a referenced authentic author. If the system could not find enough evidence of a forgery from the questioned signature feature vector, it considers the signature as genuine belonging to the referenced authentic author; otherwise it declares the signature as forged.
Handwritten signatures are biometric attributes <NO>. They suffer severely from intra-writer/within writer variations. Unlike some of the other biometric attributes, signatures are influenced by many factors from aging to psychological conditions of individuals. Despite of their difficult nature, signatures are considered as an important modality for person identification <NO>.
In general, automated signature verification is divided into two broad categories, online and offline, depending on the mode of the handwritten input. If both the spatial as well as temporal information regarding signatures are available to the systems, verification is performed on online data. In the case where temporal information is not available and the system can only utilize the spatial information gleaned through scanned or even camera captured documents, verification is performed on offline data <NO>, <NO>.
The main motivation of this paper is to take signature verification to the most commonly occurring real world scenarios, particularly in industry, where signature verification is required. Two of the most important areas where signature verification is highly demanded are, forensic signature analysis and signature verification in financial institutions. Until now online signature verification is not a common type of criminal casework for a forensic expert because the questioned signatures and the collected reference signatures (known) are commonly supplied offline <NO>. However, in most of the today’s modern financial institutions there is an increasing demand to perform signature verification in realtime right after signing contracts, etc. We focus explicitly on the online signature verification keeping in view its various applications in these institutions.
In this paper we apply our signature verification framework in different real world scenarios in connection with the Anoto digital pen. Note, however, that our framework can also be integrated with other hardware like digitizing tablets.
Figure 1 illustrates the hardware layout of the Anoto digital pen. This pen specializes in providing the look and feel of regular pens. It only demands to add Anoto dot pattern to any paper and data can be digitized seamlessly. The Anoto pattern makes it possible for the Anoto pen’s built-in camera to detect strokes and record signatures that then can be stored in an internal memory or sent via communication unit using Bluetooth/USB. Due to this ease of use, Anoto pens are finding applications in fields from health care to finance. Our signature verification framework is an attempt to take signature verification to every area where the Anoto pen finds an application. In particular our system has already been applied in test scenarios for finance institutions and product manufacturing companies."	https://doi.org/10.1109/DAS.2012.10	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Malik, et al.

Freak for real time forensic signature verification	[]	M.I. Malik, S. Ahmed, M. Liwicki, and A. Dengel 2013. Freak for real time forensic signature verification. In 12th Int. Conf. on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR’13)	This paper presents a novel signature verification system based on local features of signatures. The proposed system uses Fast Retina Keypoints (FREAK) which represent local features and are inspired by the human visual system, particularly the retina. To locate local points of interest in signatures, two local keypoint detectors, i.e., Features from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST) and Speeded-up Robust Features (SURF), have been used and their performance comparison in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER) and time is presented. The proposed system has been evaluated on publicly available dataset of forensic signature verification competition, 4NSigComp2010, which contains genuine, forged, and disguised signatures. The proposed system achieved an EER of 30%, which is considerably very low when compared against all the participants of the said competition. In addition to EER, the proposed system requires only 0.6 seconds on average to verify a 3000*1500 scanned signature. This shows that the proposed system has a potential and suitability for forensic signature verification as well as real time applications.	"Automatic signature verification is needed in various different areas of our daily life. These include banks, governmental, security, and financial institutions, etc. Since the last few decades, researchers from Pattern Recognition (PR) community are developing and continuously improving different automatic signature verification systems for both offline (where only spatial information of signatures is available) and online (where both spatial and temporal information of signatures is available) cases. In either case, (online or offline), the verification problem is usually solved by classifying signatures into two classes, i.e., either as genuine or forged. This classification is helpful in many cases, but in some areas, e.g., forensic handwriting/signature analysis, another important genre of signatures, i.e., disguised signatures, needs classification. Although in forensic examination, disguised signatures are of high importance <NO>, yet they are often neglected by PR researchers <NO>.
Disguised signatures are usually difficult to identify <NO>, as they are written by the genuine author but with intention to deny its authorship. This could be done mainly for fraud e.g., a disguised signature made on a bank check can be used to withdraw cash and later on it can be claimed that the check did not contain original signatures.. In such a case, it is very difficult for bank/financial institution officers to distinguish between genuine and disguised signatures. In addition, it is also not possible to have an expert forensic examiner available in all of the institutes, which require authentication via signatures, who can first analyze signatures and then allow the next step in the routine work flow. It is, therefore, required to enable automatic systems classify the three different genres of signatures, i.e., genuine, forged, and disguised, so that different types of such frauds can be prevented.
Existing systems for automatic signature verification are already performing very well if the goal is to identify genuine and forged signature <NO>. There are already some commercial systems available which are also being used in banking and other financial and sensitive institutions. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are only a few systems capable of disguise classification and most of them have appeared first time in the 4NSigComp2010 signature verification competition. Note that, these systems performed quite naively when disguised signatures were present in the test set and the best of these systems could reach an EER of 55%. Considering the above mentioned scenario, there is a strong need for a system which is capable of dealing with genuine, forged, and disguised signatures at the same time with reasonably low EER.
In this paper we propose a novel method for automatic signature verification, which is able to deal with genuine, forged, and disguised signatures at the same time, with comparatively low EER and very high time efficiency. The proposed method is based on part-based analysis of signature images. In particular FREAK features are used which are inspired by human visual perception. In addition to EER, the proposed method is also computationally efficient and only requires 0.6 seconds, on average, to verify an offline signature of dimensions nearly 3000∗1500. This shows that there is a strong potential for using the proposed method in various real time scenarios, such as the bank scenarios noted earlier. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated on the publicly available dataset of 4NSigComp2010 (the first ever signature verification competition with data containing disguised along with genuine and forged signatures). This data is collected by Forensic Handwriting Examiners (FHEs) from forensic-like situations <NO>.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes different automatic verification systems available for signatures. Section III provides details about the proposed system for forensic signature verification. Section IV details the dataset used for evaluation. Section V presents evaluation results in terms of EER, and execution speed on the said publicly available dataset. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper and provides hints for possible future improvements."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2013.196	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Malik, et al.

Techniques for static handwriting trajectory recovery: A survey	['Certainly, to estimate the pseudo-dynamic information needed to make the handwritten trajectories is a classic challenge <NO>.']	V. Nguyen, and M. Blumenstein 2010. Techniques for static handwriting trajectory recovery: A survey. In Proc. of the 9th IAPR Int. Workshop on Document Analysis Systems	On-line handwriting recognition systems are usually better than their off-line counterparts thanks to the accessibility of dynamic information such as stroke order, velocity, acceleration, and pressure. Whilst the exact value of velocity as well as acceleration or pressure is unlikely to be recoverable, the temporal order of the strokes or the pen trajectory is shown to be more promising for recovery. The published experimental results suggest that the recovered pen trajectory information actually improves the off-line recognition accuracy. This paper presents an overview and discussion of pen trajectory recovery methods developed to date.	"The research in automatic handwriting recognition has been intensively pursued for nearly four decades and has obtained some significant achievements <NO>. Successful applications include: postal address recognition, handwriting recognition and signature verification using tablets, historical document recognition, and form processing.
Automatic recognition systems can be categorised as being on-line or off-line based on the availability of dynamic information. On-line recognition is usually performed using temporal spatial information generated from the movement of a stylus on the surface of an electrostatic or electromagnetic tablet. Depending on the hardware, this signal stream of information may include: pen-inclination, pressure, velocity, acceleration, movement direction, number of strokes. From such information, the corresponding static image could

be simulated <NO> using ink deposition models in conjunction with trajectory interpolation functions.
Unlike its on-line counterpart, off-line recognition employs only the static images captured by optical devices such as a camera or scanner. Due to the absence of dynamic information, the accuracies of off-line recognition systems could not be as high as on-line recognition <NO>. As a trade-off, the on-the-fly collection of dynamic information restricts the applications of on-line recognition and gives off-line recognition certain unique advantages such as the ability to capture information remotely and conveniently.
The success of on-line systems <NO> encourages the recovery and utilisation of dynamic information, such as pressure <NO> and, especially, stroke order to improve the performance of off-line recognition systems. Research in the field of psychology also suggests that humans’ perception of dynamic information from static images assists in the recognition of characters <NO>. It is strongly believed that if the trajectories are properly recovered, the performance of automatic off-line handwriting recognition systems could significantly be improved <NO>. Handler et al. <NO> reported a recognition performance downgrade when off-line data was simulated using on-line data. Experimental results from <NO> later confirmed that the time ordering of the signal contains important information for the recognition of handwriting. In the literature, time ordering information has been used for word segmentation and recognition <NO>, character recognition <NO>, numeral recognition <NO>, writer identification <NO>. The application of recovered trajectories in signature verification has also been investigated. In, <NO>, on-line data which was previously obtained in a registration process provided valuable clues for the recovery of signature trajectory. In another attempt to extract and utilise the temporal order, Munich and Perona <NO> tracked the signature images as writers sign with the assistance of a camera. Despite the large number of potential applications, trajectory recovery remains an open problem.
There are two major processes in a trajectory recovery system: local examination and global reconstruction. Local examination provides the essential information which will be referred to in the global reconstruction phase. This often includes the detection and analysis of junctions or ambiguous zones, endpoints, double-traced lines but can also be extended to gray level consistency, striations, feathering, pressures, and accelerations <NO>. In global reconstruction,
the overall trajectory is determined using the information obtained from local examination. The outcome of this process can be a list of ranked trajectory candidates which may further be analysed using a knowledge-based module <NO>. The principle components of a trajectory recovery system is presented in Figure 1.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The next section, Section 2, presents both the advantages and disadvantages of input material, the skeleton and the contour. Section 3 briefly mentions the preprocessing of input images. Local examination is then detailed in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to global reconstruction techniques. Finally, issues concerning performance evaluation are discussed in Section 6."	https://doi.org/10.1145/1815330.1815390	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Nguyen, et al.

Global features for the off-line signature verification problem	['<NO> developed an verification system based on global features Vector Machine classifier.', 'We compared the performance of two feature extraction techniques, the gradient feature and the Modified Direction Feature <NO>, using a public database GPDS-160 <NO> with similar experimental settings.']	V. Nguyen, M. Blumenstein, and G. Leedham 2009. Global features for the off-line signature verification problem. In 10th Int. Conf. on Document Analysis and Recognition	Global features based on the boundary of a signature and its projections are described for enhancing the process of automated signature verification. The first global feature is derived from the total ’energy’ a writer uses to create their signature. The second feature employs information from the vertical and horizontal projections of a signature, focusing on the proportion of the distance between key strokes in the image, and the height/width of the signature. The combination of these features with the Modified Direction Feature (MDF) and the ratio feature showed promising results for the off-line signature verification problem. When being trained using 12 genuine specimens and 400 random forgeries taken from a publicly available database, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier obtained an average error rate (AER) of 17.25%. The false acceptance rate (FAR) for random forgeries was also kept as low as 0.08%.	"Handwritten signatures have long been accepted as an official means to verify personal identity for legal purposes on such documents as cheques, credit cards, contracts and wills. The handwritten signature is therefore well established and accepted as a behavioural biometric. Considering the large number of signatures verified daily through visual inspection by people, the construction of a robust and accurate automatic signature verification system has many potential benefits for ensuring authenticity of signatures and reducing fraud and other crimes. As a consequence, research into signature verification has been vigorously pursued for several decades, particularly with reference to offline verification <NO>.
Off-line verification refers to when the signature is only available as a static image, typically obtained after it has been written on paper using a variety of writing instruments, with no reference to the sequence and timing of the pen-strokes, which created the signature. When the sequence of the pen-strokes is available the process is referred to as on-line signature verification.
The off-line signature verification problem is more challenging due to the lack of valuable behavioural information about how the person created the signature in terms of penpoint velocity and accelerations, writing pressure and stroke sequence. Access to this on-line information during the training phase, has been demonstrated to result in improved performance in off-line signature verification systems <NO>.
Like any other pattern recognition scheme, one crucial aspect of a signature verification system includes appropriate feature extraction procedures. Thus, new feature extraction techniques are being extensively explored. The survey by Weiping et al. <NO> summarises some previously investigated features and approaches. In this paper we report our latest results in the pursuit of new global and local features for addressing the off-line signature verification problem."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2009.123	2	['sample']	['signature_identification', 'chain_code', 'code_direction', 'modified_chain', 'line_signatures']	['chain_code_direction', 'modified_chain_code', 'segmented_signature_image', 'signature_identification_proposed', 'line_signature_verification']	Global features based on the boundary of a signature and its projections are described for enhancing the process of automated signature verification [NO].
Off-line signature identification using background and foreground information	[]	S. Pal, A. Alaei, U. Pal, and M. Blumenstein 2011. Off-line signature identification using background and foreground information. In Int. Conf. on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA’11)	Biometric systems play an important role in the field of information security as they are extremely required for user authentication. Automatic signature recognition and verification is one of the biometric techniques, which is currently receiving renewed interest and is only one of several techniques used to verify the identities of individuals. Signatures provide a secure means for confirmation and authorization in legal documents. So nowadays, signature identification and verification becomes an essential component in automating the rapid processing of documents containing embedded signatures. In this paper, a technique for a bi-script off-line signature identification system is proposed. In the proposed signature identification system, the signatures of English and Bengali (Bangla) are considered for the identification process. Different features such as undersampled bitmaps, modified chain-code direction features and gradient features computed from both background and foreground components are employed for this purpose. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Nearest Neighbour (NN) techniques are considered as classifiers for signature identification in the proposed system. A database of 1554 English signatures and 1092 Bengali signatures are used to generate the experimental results. Various results based on different features are calculated and analysed. The highest accuracies of 99.41%, 98.45% and 97.75% are obtained based on the modified chain-code direction, under-sampled bitmaps and gradient features respectively using 1800 (1100 English+700 Bengali) samples for training and 846 (454 English+392 Bengali) samples for testing. KeywordsOffline systems, Signature identification, Biometrics, Authentication systems, Modified chain-code directions, SVMs.	"Today, biometric technologies are increasingly and more commonly being used to ensure identity verification or the authorisation of access to sensitive data. For historical reasons, the handwritten signature continues to be the most commonly accepted form of transaction confirmation, as well as being used in civil law contracts, acts of volition, or authenticating one's identity. Signature verification has been a topic of intensive research during the past several years <NO> due to the important role it plays in numerous areas, including the financial system.
Signatures have been accepted as an official means to verify personal identity for legal purposes on such documents such as cheques, credit cards, wills etc. The handwritten signature is therefore well established and accepted as a behavioral biometric. Considering the large number of signatures verified daily through visual inspection by people, the construction of a robust and accurate automatic signature verification system has many potential benefits for ensuring authenticity of signatures and reducing fraud and other crimes.
The goal of a signature verification system is to verify the identity of an individual based on an analysis of his or her signature through a process that discriminates a genuine signature from a forgery. The verification of human signatures is particularly concerned with the improvement of the interface between human-beings and computers <NO>. A signature verification system and the associated techniques used to solve the inherent problems of authentication can be divided into two classes <NO>: (a) on-line methods <NO> to measure temporal and sequential data by utilizing intelligent algorithms <NO> and (b) off-line methods <NO> that use an optical scanner to obtain handwriting data written on paper. Off-line signature verification deals with the verification of signatures, which appear in a static format <NO>. On-line signature verification has been shown to achieve much higher verification rates than off-line verification <NO>, as a considerable amount of dynamic information is lost in the off-line mode. But off-line systems have a significant advantage as they do not require access to special processing devices when the signatures are produced. Moreover, the offline method has many more practical application areas than that of the on-line variety.
Signatures represent a particular writing style and very often are a combination of symbols and strokes. So it is obviously necessary to deal with a signature as a complete image with a special distribution of pixels, representing a particular writing style and is not considered as a collection of letters and words <NO>. It is often difficult for a human to instantly verify two signatures of the same person because signature samples from the same person are similar but not identical, and signatures can change depending on elements such as mood, fatigue and time. In addition, a person’s signature often changes radically during their lifetime. Great inconsistency can even be observed in sign to country, habits, psychological or mental s practical conditions <NO>.

Matrix-based hierarchical graph matching in off-line handwritten signatures recognition	[]	M. Piekarczyk, and M.R. Ogiela 2013. Matrix-based hierarchical graph matching in off-line handwritten signatures recognition. In 2nd IAPR Asian Conf. on Pattern Recognition	In this paper, a graph-based off-line handwritten signature verification system is proposed. The system can automatically identify some global and local features which exist within different signatures of the same person. Based on these features it is possible to verify whether a signature is a forgery or not. The structural description in the form of hierarchical attributed random graph set is transformed into matrix-vector structures. These structures can be directly used as matching pattern when examined signature is analyzed. The proposed approach can be applied to off-line signature verification systems especially for kanji-like or ideogram-based structurally complex signatures. Keywords— handwritten signatures verification; attributed IE graph; matrix-based matching; hierarchical random graph; ambiguous signature patterns;	"The common approach in handwritten signatures verification systems is using of statistical pattern recognition methods <NO>. The most popular models are HMM <NO>, SVM <NO>, ANN or DTW. Though the syntactic methods in pattern recognition can be very effective <NO> these are not very popular in biometrics. Also, graph-based modeling techniques are rather rarely used by researchers in this field. Among possible reasons of the situation some difficulties related to analysis of such complicated structures as graphs, can be indicated. These types of problems appear both in syntacticoriented and template matching approaches. If the formal graph languages are used, it is necessary to cope with the high complexity membership problem (parsing) and extremely hard designing of the grammatical inference procedures (learning). On the other side, using the template matching model faced with the issue of testing the graph isomorphism in the effective way. In spite of that, some proposals of HSV systems basing on graph-based modeling has been appeared in the recent years including <NO> for on-line and <NO> for off-line signatures recognition. In both cases the graph-based modeling is used to handle the distinctive features connected with handwritten signatures.
The paper <NO> introduces a mathematical linguistic based model designed for distorted or ambiguous patterns, where a graph based approach is used for structure representation. The concept basing on the use of hierarchical random IE graphs and two-level probabilistic grammars belonging to the ETPL(k) class with the aim of gathering and analyzing the knowledge about the structure and the features of ambiguous patterns (signatures). The knowledge about variability of a specimen is created just on the basis of finite number of patterns treated as positive samples of unknown graph language. Additionally, the usage of attributed graphs enables the storage of additional semantic information describing the local properties of the signature. The graph linguistic formalisms applied – the IE graphs and attribute-controlled ETPL(k) grammar <NO> – are characterized by considerable descriptive strength and a polynomial membership problem of the syntactic analysis. However, the effective mechanism of machine learning through grammatical inference process has been defined <NO>. This model is very comprehensive but its constructional complexity may be treated as significant disadvantage.
In the approach designed to on-line handwritten signatures analysis <NO> different type of graph-based modeling has been presented. On-line signatures are represented by series of graphs, whose nodes and edges describe certain properties of sample points and relationship between points respectively. The collection of graphs is stored in the matrix-oriented form not as a formal graph grammar like in <NO>. Then, graph matching techniques are introduced to compute edit distance between graphs. This way it is possible to measure the similarity of the graphs. Calculating the edit distance between the graphs on the basis of adjacency matrices allows to avoid a difficulties related to syntactic approach (like complexity of parsing) and give the opportunity to obtain considerable simplification of the classifier construction in relation to mathematical linguistics approach.
Due to the known instability of the signing process and consequently signature features in both systems the inexact graph matching algorithms have been used. In <NO> it is done by utilization of the random graphs while in <NO> the classifier is responsible to handle it.
The aim of this paper is to introduce a matrix-oriented classifier for the graph-based model of a signature representation proposed in <NO>. It seems that simplification of the classifier construction can be useful and profitable despite existing an effective solution basing on mathematical linguistics. In the paper novel matrix-based representation of hierarchical and probabilistic graph structures is well defined and a discussion on matrix-oriented matching scheme is investigated."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ACPR.2013.164	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Piekarczyk, et al.

This paper describes a novel technique for the automatic synthesis of human handwritten-signature images, which introduces modeled variability within the generated output based on positional variation that is naturally found within genuine source data. The synthesized data were found to generate similar verification rates to those obtained using genuine data with the use of a commercial verification engine, thereby indicating the suitability of the data synthesized by using this method for a wide range of application scenarios.	"THE operational performance of all biometric systemsused for the verification and identification of humans can be assessed by investigating the successful classification of genuine or nongenuine (e.g., forged) data <NO>. Within the biometric research community, a constant goal is to identify new and improved sensors, performance-defining features, and classification algorithms to improve this operational system performance. A low error rate is generally a main priority and is critical, given the increasing prevalence of biometric systems deployed across ever larger populations.
The practical context of synthesizing these signatures is to enable the effective training and testing of biometric systems where test data are limited. Biometric systems are conventionally assessed by using reference data sets comprising samples captured from human participants for a biometric modality of interest. A meaningful evaluation of a system, with respect to both enrolment and usage issues, which is to be deployed in a large population, therefore requires a considerable amount of test data. Many classifiers (for example, neural networks) also generally require a large quantity of data to ensure an optimally trained and stable system prior to classification. To obtain this large-scale data from human participants requires significant time and effort (often with considerable financial implications), but subjects are also often unwilling to donate large numbers

of biometric samples due to concerns about possible security compromise, specifically if the data are to be released into the public domain. Similarly, the quality of samples may often be compromised through repetition and fatigue, particularly if a subject is asked to repetitively donate samples within a single session. To overcome a potential “data shortage” problem in practical situations, a number of studies have investigated synthesizing biometric data using either actual human samples as “seed” references or, in other approaches, data generated using typical patterns/images found within a modality but without reference to a particular individual <NO>. Examples of synthesized modality studies (typically focused on image-based systems) include fingerprints <NO>, <NO>, iris <NO>, <NO>, and face <NO>.
Ma et al. <NO> proposed three criteria to ensure that synthesized biometric data sets are representative of the real-life modality under study and that the artificially generated data have the “appearance” of being generated from a natural source. These criteria are flexibility, parsimony, and consistency. Flexibility implies a parameterization of the synthesis mechanism enabling variations in data representation. Parsimony aims at building a generation procedure that is as simple as the inherent complexity of data will allow. Once a generation model has been found to be flexible and simple, it is necessary to assess how well it fits the original data. The generated data must produce repeatable results within a verification system and must be representative of the original data that they aim to simulate (the consistency criterion). If this is not the case, the simulation study may result in unreliable output.
This paper describes a method of automatically generating static image-based representations of human handwritten signatures (i.e., representations based solely on visual appearance) for use in biometric-system analysis, using (two) reference signatures from an individual signer as models for the generation of synthetic data. Automatic signature verification is a commonly used form of biometric verification and identification <NO> and is a modality which can offer many advantages over other forms of biometric authentication, among which is the familiarity among the general public for the everyday use of signatures to authorize transactions and verify identity. While other studies have outlined simple methods for generating synthetic signatures (such as fitting a series of Bezier curves between two sample images <NO>) or have assessed the properties of signatures with reference to parameter modeling of forged data <NO>, <NO>, the approach outlined in this paper is based on dynamic time warping (DTW) techniques <NO> and includes novel methods for dealing with sample signatures from the same signer but with different numbers of pen strokes. It also importantly introduces spatial variability throughout synthesized signatures based on that found within genuine

signatures, resulting in images which encapsulate the natural variability found within hand-drawn signatures rather than a simple morphological mapping between two images. Our approach uses both the static (spatial) and dynamic (temporal) information within signatures, which is stored during online capture of data to generate the static synthesized images and which is generally included in sample databases. The temporal data enable the construction order to be assessed, which enables an accurate mapping between drawing sequences. Following this mapping, all subsequent operations occur in the spatial domain.
Finally, we assess the quality of the resulting synthesized images using samples from a standard online public-domain signature database (Signature Verification Competition 2004 (SVC2004) <NO>) as seed signatures and a commercial static signature verification engine as a “black-box” recognition system. In the experiment, we assess the verification performance achieved when using both genuine and forged signature images, synthesis images with variability, and, as a comparison, a second simpler method for synthesizing signature images."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.918575	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Rabasse, et al.

Online signature verification on mobile devices	['The second on-line classifier <NO> is based on the', 'vector and then employ the classical distance measure such as Euclidean, City-Block for distance computation <NO>, <NO>.']	N. Sae-Bae, and N. Memon 2014. Online signature verification on mobile devices. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security 9,	This paper studies online signature verification on touch interface-based mobile devices. A simple and effective method for signature verification is developed. An online signature is represented with a discriminative feature vector derived from attributes of several histograms that can be computed in linear time. The resulting signature template is compact and requires constant space. The algorithm was first tested on the well-known MCYT-100 and SUSIG data sets. The results show that the performance of the proposed technique is comparable and often superior to state-of-the-art algorithms despite its simplicity and efficiency. In order to test the proposed method on finger drawn signatures on touch devices, a data set was collected from an uncontrolled environment and over multiple sessions. Experimental results on this data set confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in mobile settings. The results demonstrate the problem of within-user variation of signatures across multiple sessions and the effectiveness of cross session training strategies to alleviate these problems.	"AHANDWRITTEN signature is a socially and legallyaccepted biometric trait for authenticating an individual. Typically, there are two types of handwritten signature verification systems: off-line and online systems. In an off-line system, just an image of the user’s signature is acquired without additional attributes, whereas, in an online system, a sequence of x-y coordinates of the user’s signature, along with associated attributes like pressure, time, etc., are also acquired. As a result, an online signature verification system usually achieves better accuracy than an off-line system <NO>.
The increasing number of personal computing devices that come equipped with a touch sensitive interface and the difficulty of entering a password on such devices <NO> have led to an interest in developing alternative authentication mechanisms on them <NO>, <NO>. In this context, an online signature is a plausible candidate given the familiarity users have with the concept of using a signature for the purpose of authentication.
There has been much work on online signature verification systems <NO>–<NO>. However, none of this has been directed to the context of authentication on mobile devices. Previous work has addressed online signatures acquired from traditional digitizers in a controlled environment. These are different from those acquired from mobile devices in dynamic environments. First, on mobile devices, a user performs his signatures in various contexts, i.e., sitting or standing, mobile or immobile, and holding a device at different angles and orientations. Secondly, availability of computational resources may differ from one signature instance to another and it could result in greater variation of input resolution when compared to that of stand-alone acquisition devices. Last, signatures on mobile devices are often drawn using a finger instead of a stylus resulting in less precise signals. An example of finger drawn signatures acquired from mobile devices is depicted in Figure 1.
Consequently, verification performance derived from traditional datasets, collected using stylus-based devices in a controlled environment, may not carry over to online signature verification on mobile device setting <NO>–<NO>. In addition, other characteristics of the system, i.e., a template aging <NO> and effectiveness of cross-sessions training, may be different when signatures are obtained from a mobile device.
This paper proposes an online signature verification algorithm that is suitable to deploy on mobile devices. It is a computationally and space efficient algorithm for enrolling and verifying signatures. In addition, a signature template is stored in an irreversible form thereby providing privacy protection to an original online signature. The proposed method was evaluated on public datasets as well as new dataset collected in in uncontrolled setting from user owned mobile devices. The verification performance obtained is promising. The key contributions made by this paper are as follows:
1) A method to extract a model-free non-invertible feature set from an online signature is proposed. The feature set comprises of sets of histograms that capture distributions of attributes generated from raw signature data sequences and their combinations. By evaluating the proposed method on public datasets, its verification performance is superior to several state of the art algorithms. 2) A new dataset was collected from 180 users in a mobile device verification environment. The signatures in this dataset were drawn with a fingertip, in an uncontrolled setting on user owned iOS devices and over six separate sessions with intervals ranging from 12 to 96 hours. 3) By applying the proposed method on the above dataset, the following aspects of online signature verification on mobile devices were investigated:
• impact of template aging on online signatures, • effectiveness of using cross-session samples, or
samples from multiple sessions, to train a classifier, and • security of the system against random forgery, or zero-effort attack, and its comparison to that of 4-digit PIN.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a process of deriving a set of histograms from an online signature, gives details of the proposed online signature verification system, and analyzes its complexity. Section III provides experimental results on public datasets. In section IV, a method and apparatus for collecting a new dataset as well as experimental results and analysis on this dataset is presented. Lastly, in section V, conclusions and future work are discussed."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2316472	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Sae-Bae, et al.

User authentication using combination of behavioral biometrics over the touchpad acting like touch screen of mobile device	['In <NO>, keystroke dynamics were used to authenticate 10 users entering digits on a touch pad.']	H. Saevanee, and P. Bhatarakosol 2008. User authentication using combination of behavioral biometrics over the touchpad acting like touch screen of mobile device. In Int. Conf. on Computer and Electrical Engineering (ICCEE’08)	Now mobile devices are developed to serve various functions, storing the sensitive information. In order to protect those information and mobile systems from unauthorized users, the authentication system must be installed unavoidably. Additionally, the development of the mobile system is moving forward to the touch screen system for user friendly and quick access mechanism. In this paper, we proposed behavioral manners of users over the touchpad acting like touch screen that is able to detect the finger pressure. These behaviors are keystroke dynamics and the finger pressure. The finding has shown that, the finger pressure gives the discriminative information more than keystroke dynamics with the k-NN analytical method. Moreover, using only the finger pressure produces high accuracy rate of 99%.	"Nowadays, Mobile devices, such as cellular phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), become widespread in excess over 3 billion users <NO>. Most of them are operated by touching a display commonly used because the touch screen interface is easy to use and user-friendly operates. Currently, mobile devices are used to not only make or receive a call, take photos, and play video games, but also give the special assistance in the business, such as providing internet access, directing access to e-mail and cooperating data, transferring money, and managing bank account. As a consequence, the authentication of users for mobile devices has become an important issue.
According to <NO>, the authentication on mobile devices can be classified in three fundamental approaches. The first approach is using a PIN (Personal Identification Number) or a password which is a secrete-knowledge based technique. This technique
offers a standard level of protection and provide cheap and quick authentication. Unfortunately, it is not enough to the safeguard mobile device and data access through them because passwords have never been completely protected by the owners; sharing passwords with friends or any other systems are unavoidable problems. Moreover, the result of a survey from <NO> has shown that most users agree that using PIN is very inconvenient and they do not have confidence in the protection of the PIN facility provides.
The second approach is the token-based technique or SIM (Subscriber Identification Module). In this approach, when users do not want to use the mobile, the mobile’s SIM must be removed. However, removing SIM is not recommended due to inconvenient manners.
The last approach is applying the biometric technique. This technique is based on a unique characteristic of a person that provides an improvement on the current authentication. Biometrics relevance with the identification and verification of individual based on human characteristics. Biometric approaches are typically subdivided into two categories: physiological and behavioral biometrics. Physiological biometric is based on bodily characteristics, such as fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris scanning. Behavioral biometric is based on the way people do things, such as keystroke dynamics, mouse movement, and speech recognition.
Using any kind of mobile phones, people cannot avoid interact with keystroke dynamics. However, each person may have different styles to press the key because the typing style is based on user’s experience and individual skill which is difficult to imitate.
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the behavioral manner of users when dialing the phone number on touchpad acting like touch screen on the mobile touch screen detected force in the future <NO>. Using keystroke dynamics and the finger pressure information are the features to authenticate users to increase the accuracy using the combination of behavioral biometrics.
The remaining of this paper is organized in six sections. In the Section II is presented works published in the area. In the Section III, the purpose of methodology is discussed: gathering the data, extracting the features, and data structuring and anglicizing. The results are presented in Section IV and discuss in Section V. Finally, the conclusions and future work are presented in Section VI."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEE.2008.157	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Saevanee, et al.

A novel online signature verification system based on GMM features in a DTW framework	[]	A. Sharma, and S. Sundaram 2017. A novel online signature verification system based on GMM features in a DTW framework. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security 12,	This paper presents a novel online signature verification system based on the extension of the traditional dynamic time warping (DTW) matching scheme. We propose the use of a set of features derived from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the alignment of the signatures using DTW. These features aid in capturing signature-dependent characteristics of a user in the feature space with a probabilistic framework. In addition, we explore the characteristics of the warping path of DTW, by employing the proposed GMM features. We derive a score for the warping path, and fuse it to that of the DTW score for verifying the authenticity of a test signature. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind that uses the features of the GMM, a model-based classifier into the framework of the DTW technique for online signature verification. The experiments are conducted on the publicly available MCYT database for both common and user thresholds. The results obtained are promising over prior works for this database.	"IN RECENT times, owing to security concerns, authen-tication of a person has become a necessity. Traditional means of authentication include the use of password and/or PIN number. These have a disadvantage that they can be either forgotten or stolen. Bio-metrics refers to identification of a person based on their physical or behavioral characteristics <NO>. It is inherently, more reliable than traditional systems such as passwords. It is desired that a candidate biometric used in an authentication system demonstrates the properties of universality, distinctiveness, permanence, and acceptability <NO>.
From the works in literature, the field of bio-metrics is categorized to one of two types, namely (i) physiological and (ii) behavioral. The physiological bio-metrics employ direct measurements of a part of the human body, such as fingerprint, face, iris and hand-scan for identification. On the other hand, behavioral bio-metrics operate on features derived from data obtained from an action performed by the user. A signature is one such bio-metric that falls into this category. In a signature verification system, features of a test signature are contrasted against those from a set of enrolled genuine signatures of an user whose identity is to be authenticated. This leads to one of two possible outcomes: either the claimed signature is accepted as genuine or it is rejected as forgery.
The recent trend in technology has led to the release of devices offering a pen based interface to input handwritten data. Such devices, referred to as hand-held devices are manufactured small, portable and are easy to use. They primarily utilize an electronic pen (referred to as stylus) to capture data on a pressure-sensitive screen. The dynamic information of handwriting, such as (x, y) spatial location, pressure, azimuth and inclination are recorded in the device by sensing the movements of the pen-tip. In the literature, the processing of such data is referred to as online. This makes it different with regards to the off-line case, where-in only the completed writing in the form of a bitmap image is available for analysis using image processing techniques.
The input to any online signature verification system comprises a set of strokes, each of which in turn are a sequence of points. A stroke starts with a pen-down movement and ends with the next pen-up movement. It is presented by its duration and a sequence of x and y coordinates, along with other dynamic information."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2016.2632063	0	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']	['handwritten_signatures', 'skill_forgeries', 'state_art', 'the_results', 'dynamic_signatures']	['online_signature_verification', 'handwritten_signature_verification', 'equal_error_rate', 'in_paper_propose', 'methods_signature_verification']	Sharma, et al.

Offline loop investigation for handwriting analysis	['<NO>, the contour was used to classify holes, identify hidden loops and hidden natural sub-loops.', 'A loop, which is made of several strokes, is formed when the writing instrument revisits a previous position while touching the writing surface continuously <NO>.', '<NO> used contour bank segments to determine the next course of the pen trajectory.', '<NO> 2009 Contour Loops 540 loops from IRONOFF database 80.']	T. Steinherz, D. Doermann, E. Rivlin, and N. Intrator 2009. Offline loop investigation for handwriting analysis. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 31,	Resolution of different types of loops in handwritten script presents a difficult task and is an important step in many classic word recognition systems, writer modeling, and signature verification. When processing a handwritten script, a great deal of ambiguity occurs when strokes overlap, merge, or intersect. This paper presents a novel loop modeling and contour-based handwriting analysis that improves loop investigation. We show excellent results on various loop resolution scenarios, including axial loop understanding and collapsed loop recovery. We demonstrate our approach for loop investigation on several realistic data sets of static binary images and compare with the ground truth of the genuine online signal.	"SHARING many of the trajectory singularities, loops appearas one of the most dominant features available in cursive handwriting processing <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. In particular, loops are the key to successful offline-to-online-based word recognition systems, i.e., those mapping a static (bitmap) image to an ordered list of pixel locations along a time axis <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. It is useful to investigate how improved loop detection and recognition can facilitate not only character recognition but also writer modeling for identification and examination <NO>, <NO>, <NO> and script or style identification <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. Similarly, many other applications in forensic science, such as signature verification, could benefit from loop analysis <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>.
The dominance of loops in these tasks reflects in part on their frequent presence in handwritten cursive words and their parameterizable descriptive nature. J.C. Simon first elucidated the elementary nature of loops and provided an intuitive definition of the types of loops <NO>: “Displacing a pen from left to right in an oscillating movement, with loops, descendants (legs), and ascendants (poles).” Moreover, in the common case of pure cursive handwriting, its continuous nature constrains many ascending and descending strokes in a loop form. Therefore, we consider an extended definition of loops to contain all kinds of uninterrupted enclosures <NO>, including those with invisible “holes.” Thus, loops can be
found in the usual letters like a, d, e, g, o, p, q, and in letters like b, f , h, j, k, l, s, t, y, and z. In most cases, any stroke intersection, excluding delayed strokes, relates to some kind of a loop.
The significance of loops increases because of their parameterizable nature, which enables the transformation of a static loop image into a quantified feature vector. Thus, the loop provides information in a format usable in machine learning algorithms. Given the ground truth for genuine loops provided by the online signal, loop investigation essentially tries to understand the isomorphism between the offline image and the online signal. Unfortunately, such a transformation is not straightforward <NO>.
Loop investigation has been considered in the context of enhancing offline handwritten word representation and the reconstruction of the genuine ordered list of strokes. It has been done mostly by using temporal (dynamic) information recovery techniques such as contour analysis <NO>, <NO>, gray-scale examination <NO>, <NO>, and path minimization <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. Other methods include thinning/skeletonization <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO>, <NO> and morphological loop investigation <NO>, <NO>, <NO>. This paper improves aspects of former solutions; we detect and resolve the structure of most loops. Our method uses a sophisticated contour analysis we call The Multipartite Matching Approach. Our algorithm is beneficial in cases, where a complete offline to online transformation is desired.
This paper has four main sections: Section 2 introduces the theory of loops; in Sections 3 and 4, The Multipartite Matching Approach and its implementation are demonstrated; Section 5 provides experimental results. The concluding section provides a final discussion."	https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.68	1	['technique', 'svm', 'accuracy']	['based_technique', 'japanese_signature', 'mahalanobis_distance', 'svm_based', 'line_features']	['based_technique_employs', 'decision_verification_performed', 'evaluation_test_proposed', 'feature_based_technique', 'final_decision_verification']	Steinherz, et al.

On-line signature verification using graph representation	[]	K. Wang, Y. Wang, and Z. Zhang 2011. On-line signature verification using graph representation. In 6th Int. Conf. on Image and Graphics	This paper proposes a novel approach of on-line signature verification. Firstly, on-line signatures are represented by a series of graphs, whose nodes and edges describe certain properties at sample points and relationship between points respectively. Then, graph matching techniques are introduced to compute edit distance between graphs, which measures the similarity of graphs. Finally, having been able to compare any two signatures through the last two steps, user-dependent classifiers are trained using limited genuine signatures. The proposed method is tested on SUSIG on-line signature database and shows promising performance. Keywords-signature verification, on-line signature, graph representation, graph matching, biometrics	"Signatures are widely accepted as the common method of identity verification. On-line signatures make use of the dynamic features extracted by pressure sensitive tablets or digital pens, exploiting more useful information than traditional off-line signature, thus provide more reliable protection against forgeries. Examples of traditional signatures and on-line signatures are given in Fig.1, and each point in on-line signature contains abundant information like pen position and pen-tip pressure. To verify the authenticity of signatures, signature verification problem could be attributed to a two-class pattern recognition problem, the process of which is shown in Fig.2.
A wide range of pattern recognition methods can be applied to signature verification. As one of the most popular method in signal processing, dynamic time warping (DTW) has been applied to signatures verification in many researches. DTW allows the compression or expansion of the time axis of two time sequence representative of signatures to obtain the minimum of a given distance value <NO>. It has been
Figure 2. Framework of signature verification
extensively used in the field of on-line signature verification and has derived a bunch of methods taking advantages of other methods <NO><NO><NO>. Improvements have also been made to deal with DTW’s disadvantage of time consuming.
Meanwhile, intensive research has been devoted to hidden Markov model (HMM) as well. An HMM is a double stochastic approach in which one underlying yet unobservable process may be estimated through a set of processes that produce a sequence of observations. The topological structures of left-to-right, ring and ergodic have been respectively looked into <NO><NO><NO>. However, HMM makes a large assumption about the data, requires a lot of positive sample and needs too many parameters.
As in many other aspects of pattern recognition, support vector machine (SVM) turns out to be a promising approach to signature verification. It maps input vectors to a higher dimensional space in which clusters may be determined by a maximal separating hyperplane. When applied to on-line signature verification, SVM gives convincing results. New kernel functions have also been proposed to improve the performance <NO>.
However, it has come to our attention that some methods involving graph representation of signature and graph matching had been applied to off-line signature verification <NO>, while to our knowledge, there has been few works on on-line signature verification in such ways. However, there have been some trials on string matching <NO>, which can be seen as special cases of graph matching.
In this paper, we propose an approach of on-line signature verification using graph representation. Represented by graphs, signatures are compared using graph matching methods. As is NP-complete, graph matching is a classic problem in the field of algorithms. Therefore, there have been many efficient graph matching algorithms that can be made use of.
The organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the graph representation and graph matching method adopted in our work. The details of the training and testing procedure will be given in Section 3. Section 4 demonstrates the experiment results while Section 5 draws the conclusion."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIG.2011.57	2	['sample']	['signature_identification', 'chain_code', 'code_direction', 'modified_chain', 'line_signatures']	['chain_code_direction', 'modified_chain_code', 'segmented_signature_image', 'signature_identification_proposed', 'line_signature_verification']	Wang, et al.
