8	Virtual machine scheduling for multicores considering effects of shared on-chip last level cache interference	[]	Shin-gyu Kim, Hyeonsang Eom, and Heon Y. Yeom. 2012. Virtual machine scheduling for multicores considering effects of shared on-chip last level cache interference. International Green Computing Conference (IGCC). IEEE, 1–6. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322250	As the cloud markets grow, the cloud providers are faced with new challenges such as reduction of power consumption and guaranteeing service level agreements (SLAs). One reason for these problems is the use of server consolidation policy based on virtualization technologies for maximizing the efficiency of resource usage. Because current virtualization technologies do not ensure performance isolation among active virtual machines (VMs), it is required to consider resource usage pattern of VMs to improve total throughput and quality of service. In this paper, we propose a virtual machine scheduler for multicore processors, which exploits the lastlevel cache (LLC) reference ratio. Specifically, we focus on the performance impact of contention in a shared LLC. We have found that the ratio of the number of LLC references to that of instructions (LLC reference ratio) is highly associated with the amount of cache demand, and a Performance-Maximizing VM (PMV) scheduling algorithm can be devised by using the ratio. We show that our PMV scheduler is effective by evaluation for various workloads. Keywords-Virtual machine consolidation; Shared resource interference; Multicore processor	In this section, we describe a cache hierachy in modern multicore processors and how to characterize cache demand of a workload by LLC reference ratio.	https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322250	2	['processor', 'center', 'virtualization']	['multi_core', 'cooling_power', 'core_cluster', 'energy_dissipation', 'energy_consumption']	['multi_core_cluster', 'floor_data_centers', 'raised_floor_data', 'data_centers_operate', 'minimum_energy_consumption']	Kim, et al.

19	Virtualization: A survey on concepts, taxonomy and associated security issues	[]	Jyotiprakash Sahoo, Subasish Mohapatra, and Radha Lath. 2010. Virtualization: A survey on concepts, taxonomy and associated security issues. 2nd International Conference on Computer and Network Technology (ICCNT’10). IEEE. 222–226. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCNT.2010.49	Virtualization is a term that refers to the abstraction of computer resources. The purpose of virtual computing environment is to improve resource utilization by providing a unified integrated operating platform for users and applications based on aggregation of heterogeneous and autonomous resources. More recently, virtualization at all levels (system, storage, and network) became important again as a way to improve system security, reliability and availability, reduce costs, and provide greater flexibility. This paper explains the basics of system virtualization and addresses pros and cons of virtualization along with taxonomy and challenges. Keywords— Virtualization; hypervisor; VMM; Security; Threats.	"Virtualization was first developed in 1960’s by IBM Corporation, originally to partition large mainframe computer into several logical instances and to run on single physical mainframe hardware as the host. This feature was invented because maintaining the larger mainframe computers became cumbersome. The scientist realized that this capability of partitioning allows multiple processes and applications to run at the same time, thus increasing the efficiency of the environment and decreasing the maintenance overhead. Although the main focus of this paper is to provide an overview of security vulnerabilities in a virtual environment. It
is worth mentioning some of the security benefits that comes together with virtualization. Two primary benefits offered by any virtualization technology are
• Resource sharing - Unlike in non-virtualized environment where all the resources are dedicated to the running programs, in virtualized environment the VMs shares the physical resources such as memory, disk and network devices of the underlying host.
• Isolation - One of the key issues in virtualization provides isolation between virtual machines that are running on the same physical hardware. Programs running in one virtual machine cannot see programs running in another virtual machine."	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCNT.2010.49	2	['processor', 'center', 'virtualization']	['multi_core', 'cooling_power', 'core_cluster', 'energy_dissipation', 'energy_consumption']	['multi_core_cluster', 'floor_data_centers', 'raised_floor_data', 'data_centers_operate', 'minimum_energy_consumption']	Sahoo, et al.
