Experiments are carried out using both off-line systems, involving the discrimination of signatures written on a piece of paper, and on-line systems, in which dynamic information of the signing process (such as velocity and acceleration) is also available. We use for our experiments the BiosecurID database, which contains both on-line and offline versions of signatures, acquired in four sessions across a 4 month time span with incremental level of skill in the forgeries for different sessions. We compare several scenarios with different size and variability of the enrolment set, showing that the problem of skilled forgeries can be alleviated as we consider more signatures for enrolment.

dtw warping gmm path score characteristic framework alignment authenticity capturing derive explore extension fuse prior probabilistic feature kind common threshold 	0	A novel online signature verification system based on GMM features in a DTW framework	This paper presents a novel online signature verification system based on the extension of the traditional dynamic time warping (DTW) matching scheme. We propose the use of a set of features derived from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the alignment of the signatures using DTW. These features aid in capturing signature-dependent characteristics of a user in the feature space with a probabilistic framework. In addition, we explore the characteristics of the warping path of DTW, by employing the proposed GMM features. We derive a score for the warping path, and fuse it to that of the DTW score for verifying the authenticity of a test signature. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind that uses the features of the GMM, a model-based classifier into the framework of the DTW technique for online signature verification. The experiments are conducted on the publicly available MCYT database for both common and user thresholds. The results obtained are promising over prior works for this database.

In order to protect those information and mobile systems from unauthorized users, the authentication system must be installed unavoidably. Additionally, the development of the mobile system is moving forward to the touch screen system for user friendly and quick access mechanism. In this paper, we proposed behavioral manners of users over the touchpad acting like touch screen that is able to detect the finger pressure. These behaviors are keystroke dynamics and the finger pressure. The finding has shown that, the finger pressure gives the discriminative information more than keystroke dynamics with the k-NN analytical method. Moreover, using only the finger pressure produces high accuracy rate of 99%.	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']
session algorithm mobile problem effectiveness multiple touch device data alleviate an attribute compact comparable constant cross despite drawn efficiency environment 	0	Online signature verification on mobile devices	This paper studies online signature verification on touch interface-based mobile devices. A simple and effective method for signature verification is developed. An online signature is represented with a discriminative feature vector derived from attributes of several histograms that can be computed in linear time. The resulting signature template is compact and requires constant space. The algorithm was first tested on the well-known MCYT-100 and SUSIG data sets. The results show that the performance of the proposed technique is comparable and often superior to state-of-the-art algorithms despite its simplicity and efficiency. In order to test the proposed method on finger drawn signatures on touch devices, a data set was collected from an uncontrolled environment and over multiple sessions. Experimental results on this data set confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in mobile settings. The results demonstrate the problem of within-user variation of signatures across multiple sessions and the effectiveness of cross session training strategies to alleviate these problems.

To overcome this problem, techniques to generate synthetic data have been developed. This paper describes a novel technique for the automatic synthesis of human handwritten-signature images, which introduces modeled variability within the generated output based on positional variation that is naturally found within genuine source data. The synthesized data were found to generate similar verification rates to those obtained using genuine data with the use of a commercial verification engine, thereby indicating the suitability of the data synthesized by using this method for a wide range of application scenarios.

The system can automatically identify some global and local features which exist within different signatures of the same person. Based on these features it is possible to verify whether a signature is a forgery or not. The structural description in the form of hierarchical attributed random graph set is transformed into matrix-vector structures. These structures can be directly used as matching pattern when examined signature is analyzed. The proposed approach can be applied to off-line signature verification systems especially for kanji-like or ideogram-based structurally complex signatures.

Whilst the exact value of velocity as well as acceleration or pressure is unlikely to be recoverable, the temporal order of the strokes or the pen trajectory is shown to be more promising for recovery. The published experimental results suggest that the recovered pen trajectory information actually improves the off-line recognition accuracy. This paper presents an overview and discussion of pen trajectory recovery methods developed to date.	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']

The proposed system uses Fast Retina Keypoints (FREAK) which represent local features and are inspired by the human visual system, particularly the retina. To locate local points of interest in signatures, two local keypoint detectors, i.e., Features from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST) and Speeded-up Robust Features (SURF), have been used and their performance comparison in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER) and time is presented. The proposed system has been evaluated on publicly available dataset of forensic signature verification competition, 4NSigComp2010, which contains genuine, forged, and disguised signatures. The proposed system achieved an EER of 30%, which is considerably very low when compared against all the participants of the said competition. In addition to EER, the proposed system requires only 0.6 seconds on average to verify a 3000*1500 scanned signature. This shows that the proposed system has a potential and suitability for forensic signature verification as well as real time applications.	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']
framework digital anoto gmm pen scenario card financial mixture skilled classification online applicable apply client commodity contract demand easy general 	0	A signature verification framework for digital pen applications	In this paper we present a framework for realtime online signature verification scenarios. The proposed framework is based on state-of-the-art feature extraction and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classification. While our signature verification library is generally applicable to any input device using digital pens, we have implemented verification scenarios using the Anoto digital pen. As such our automated signature verification framework becomes an interesting commodity for industry, because the Anoto SDK is easy to apply and the GMM-based classification can be seamlessly integrated. The novelty of this work is the application of our framework that takes real-time online signature verification to every scenario where digital pens may potentially be used. In this paper we describe several scenarios where our framework has been applied, including signatures in financial contracts or ordering processes. We also propose a general approach to integrate the GMM-descriptions into electronic ID-cards in order to also store behavioral biometrics on these cards. In experiments we have measured the performance of the signature verification system when skilled forgeries were present. The interest shown by our partner financial institutions and the results of our initial evaluations indicate that our signature verification framework suits exactly the demands of our clients.

template recognition bioconvolving protected renewability transformation transformed authentication biometric security applied computationally degradation expense guessing hard however main noninvertible obstacle 	0	Cancelable templates for sequence-based biometrics with application to on-line signature recognition	Recent years have seen the rapid spread of biometric technologies for automatic people recognition. However, security and privacy issues still represent the main obstacles for the deployment of biometric-based authentication systems. In this paper, we propose an approach, which we refer to as BioConvolving, that is able to guarantee security and renewability to biometric templates. Specifically, we introduce a set of noninvertible transformations, which can be applied to any biometrics whose template can be represented by a set of sequences, in order to generate multiple transformed versions of the template. Once the transformation is performed, retrieving the original data from the transformed template is computationally as hard as random guessing. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach is applied to an on-line signature recognition system, where a hidden Markov model-based matching strategy is employed. The performance of a protected on-line signature recognition system employing the proposed BioConvolving approach is evaluated, both in terms of authentication rates and renewability capacity, using the MCYT signature database. The reported extensive set of experiments shows that protected and renewable biometric templates can be properly generated and used for recognition, at the expense of a slight degradation in authentication performance.

The systems have to rate the probability of authorship and non-authorship of signatures. In particular they have to determine whether questioned signatures are simulated disguised or the normal signature of the reference writer. Furthermore, the results will be compared to forensic handwriting examiners (FHEs) opinions on the same tasks. As such, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this scenario will be the first attempt in literature to relate system performances to the performance of FHEs who gave their opinion on exactly the the same signatures.

We want to bridge the gap between recent technological developments and forensic casework. In collaboration with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence we have organized a signature verification competition on datasets with two scripts (Dutch and Chinese) in which we asked to compare questioned signatures against a set of reference signatures. We have received 12 systems from 5 institutes and performed experiments on online and offline Dutch and Chinese signatures. For evaluation, we applied methods used by Forensic Handwriting Examiners (FHEs) to assess the value of the evidence, i.e., we took the likelihood ratios more into account than in previous competitions.

Gradient features are extracted from a signature image reflecting the velocity of pen movement as the grayscale so that both on-line and off-line features are exploited. All training samples of different signatures collected in design stage are pooled together with the user’s samples and used for learning within-individual variation to reduce required sample size of the user to minimum number. The result of evaluation test shows that the proposed technique improves the verification accuracy by 4.9% when user’s sample of size three is pooled with samples with others. This result shows that the samples of different signatures are useful for training within-individual variation of a specific user.

The proposed technique is based on the Singular Value Decomposition in finding r singular vectors sensing the maximal energy of glove data matrixA, called principal subspace, so the effective dimensionality ofA can be reduced. Having modeled the data glove signature through its r-principal subspace, signature authentication is performed by finding the angles between the different subspaces. A demonstration of the data glove is presented as an effective highbandwidth data entry device for signature verification. This SVD-based signature verification technique is tested and its performance is shown to be able to produce Equal Error Rate (EER) of less than 2.37 percent.	['user', 'recognition', 'algorithm']

hmm u ua likelihood ubm viterbi evidence system generative influence lowest obtains ubms set ratio first included path score model 	0	Online signature verification based on generative models	The success of generative models for online signature verification has motivated many research works on this topic. These systems may use hidden Markov models (HMMs) in two different modes: user-specific HMM (US-HMM) and user-adapted universal background models (UBMs) (UA-UBMs). Verification scores can be obtained from likelihood ratios and a distance measure on the Viterbi decoded state sequences. This paper analyzes several factors that can modify the behavior of these systems and which have not been deeply studied yet. First, we study the influence of the feature set choice, paying special attention to the role of dynamic information order, suitability of feature sets on each kind of generative model-based system, and the importance of inclination angles and pressure. Moreover, this analysis is also extended to the influence of the HMM complexity in the performance of the different approaches. For this study, a set of experiments is performed on the publicly available MCYT-100 database using only skilled forgeries. These experiments provide interesting outcomes. First, the Viterbi path evidences a notable stability for most of the feature sets and systems. Second, in the case of US-HMM systems, likelihood evidence obtains better results when lowest order dynamics are included in the feature set, while likelihood ratio obtains better results in UA-UBM systems when lowest dynamics are not included in the feature set. Finally, US-HMM and UA-UBM systems can be used together for improved verification performance by fusing at the score level the Viterbi path information from the US-HMM system and the likelihood ratio evidence from the UA-UBM system. Additional comparisons to other state-of-the-art systems, from the ESRA 2011 signature evaluation contest, are also reported, reinforcing the high performance of the systems and the generality of the experimental results described in this paper.

affine duplicate duplication heuristic nonlinear cognitive transformation motor algorithm human advance artificially duplicator historically improving increasing know map neuroscience procedure 	0	Generation of duplicated off-line signature images for verification systems	Biometric researchers have historically seen signature duplication as a procedure relevant to improving the performance of automatic signature verifiers. Different approaches have been proposed to duplicate dynamic signatures based on the heuristic affine transformation, nonlinear distortion and the kinematic model of the motor system. The literature on static signature duplication is limited and as far as we know based on heuristic affine transforms and does not seem to consider the recent advances in human behavior modeling of neuroscience. This paper tries to fill this gap by proposing a cognitive inspired algorithm to duplicate off-line signatures. The algorithm is based on a set of nonlinear and linear transformations which simulate the human spatial cognitive map and motor system intra-personal variability during the signing process. The duplicator is evaluated by increasing artificially a training sequence and verifying that the performance of four state-of-the-art off-line signature classifiers using two publicly databases have been improved on average as if we had collected three more real signatures.

According to the Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements, these parameters contain information on both the motor commands and the timing properties of a neuromuscular system. The new algorithm, called XZERO, exploits relationships between the zero crossings of the first and second time derivatives of a lognormal function and its four basic parameters. The methodology is described and then evaluated under various testing conditions. The new tool allows a greater variety of stroke patterns to be processed automatically. Furthermore, for the first time, the extraction accuracy is quantified empirically, taking advantage of the exponential relationships that link the dispersion of the extraction errors with its signal-to-noise ratio. A new extraction system which combines this algorithm with two other previously published methods is also described and evaluated. This system provides researchers involved in various domains of pattern analysis and artificial intelligence with new tools for the basic study of single strokes as primitives for understanding rapid human movements.

generation static motor effector equivalence synthesizer level our dynamic action adapt connected continuous divide emulated engram extracting filter grid highly 	0	A behavioral handwriting model for static and dynamic signature synthesis	The synthetic generation of static handwritten signatures based on motor equivalence theory has been recently proposed for biometric applications. Motor equivalence divides the human handwriting action into an effector dependent cognitive level and an effector independent motor level. The first level has been suggested by others as an engram, generated through a spatial grid, and the second has been emulated with kinematic filters. Our paper proposes a development of this methodology in which we generate dynamic information and provide a unified comprehensive synthesizer for both static and dynamic signature synthesis. The dynamics are calculated by lognormal sampling of the 8-connected continuous signature trajectory, which includes, as a novelty, the pen-ups. The forgery generation imitates a signature by extracting the most perceptually relevant points of the given genuine signature and interpolating them. The capacity to synthesize both static and dynamic signatures using a unique model is evaluated according to its ability to adapt to the static and dynamic signature interand intra-personal variability. Our highly promising results suggest the possibility of using the synthesizer in different areas beyond the generation of unlimited databases for biometric training.

Good results have been obtained using rotation invariant uniform local binary patterns LBP plus LBP and statistical measures from gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) with MCYT and GPDS offline signature corpuses. In these studies the corpuses contain signatures written on a uniform white “nondistorting” background, however the gray level distribution of signature strokes changes when it is written on a complex background, such as a check or an invoice. The aim of this paper is to measure gray level features robustness when it is distorted by a complex background and also to propose more stable features. A set of different checks and invoices with varying background complexity is blended with the MCYT and GPDS signatures. The blending model is based on multiplication. The signature models are trained with genuine signatures on white background and tested with other genuine and forgeries mixed with different backgrounds. Results show that a basic version of local binary patterns (LBP) or local derivative and directional patterns are more robust than rotation invariant uniform LBP or GLCM features to the gray level distortion when using a support vector machine with histogram oriented kernels as a classifier.

We propose a set of 30 behavioral touch features that can be extracted from raw touchscreen logs and demonstrate that different users populate distinct subspaces of this feature space. In a systematic experiment designed to test how this behavioral pattern exhibits consistency over time, we collected touch data from users interacting with a smart phone using basic navigation maneuvers, i.e., up–down and left–right scrolling. We propose a classification framework that learns the touch behavior of a user during an enrollment phase and is able to accept or reject the current user by monitoring interaction with the touch screen. The classifier achieves a median equal error rate of 0% for intrasession authentication, 2%–3% for intersession authentication, and below 4% when the authentication test was carried out one week after the enrollment phase. While our experimental findings disqualify this method as a standalone authentication mechanism for long-term authentication, it could be implemented as a means to extend screen-lock time or as a part of a multimodal biometric authentication system.

Global features of online signatures are used to form an interval-valued feature vectors. Methods for signature verification and recognition based on the symbolic representation are also proposed. We exploit the notions of writer-dependent threshold and introduce the concept of feature-dependent threshold to achieve a significant reduction in equal error rate. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme in discriminating the genuine signatures from the forgeries. We investigate the feasibility of the proposed representation scheme for signature verification and also signature recognition using all 16,500 signatures from 330 individuals of the MCYT bimodal biometric database. Further, extensive experimentations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods by projecting features onto Eigenspace and Fisherspace. Unlike other existing signature verification methods, the proposed method is simple and efficient. The results of the experimentations reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms several other existing verification methods, including the state-of-the-art method for signature verification.

First, interfeature dependencies in a signature are exploited by decomposing the shape (horizontal trajectory, vertical trajectory) into two partitions based on the velocity profile of the base-signature for each signer, which offers the flexibility of analyzing both low and high-curvature portions of the trajectory independently. Further, these velocity-based shape partitions are analyzed directionally on the basis of relative angles. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then used to find the decision boundary between the genuine and forgery class. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in on-line signature verification in comparison with other techniques.

The technique integrates a longest common subsequences (LCSS) detection algorithm which measures the similarity of signature time series into a kernel function for support vector machines (SVM). LCSS offers the possibility to consider the local variability of signals such as the time series of pen-tip coordinates on a graphic tablet, forces on a pen, or inclination angles of a pen measured during a signing process. Consequently, the similarity of two signature time series can be determined in a more reliable way than with other measures. A proprietary database with signatures of 153 test persons and the SVC 2004 benchmark database are used to show the properties of the new SVM-LCSS. We investigate its parameterization and compare it to SVM with other kernel functions such as dynamic time warping (DTW). Our experiments show that SVM with the LCSS kernel authenticate persons very reliably and with a performance which is significantly better than that of the best comparing technique, SVM with DTW kernel.

The combination of these features with the Modified Direction Feature (MDF) and the ratio feature showed promising results for the off-line signature verification problem. When being trained using 12 genuine specimens and 400 random forgeries taken from a publicly available database, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier obtained an average error rate (AER) of 17.25%. The false acceptance rate (FAR) for random forgeries was also kept as low as 0.08%.	['sample']

Automatic signature recognition and verification is one of the biometric techniques, which is currently receiving renewed interest and is only one of several techniques used to verify the identities of individuals. Signatures provide a secure means for confirmation and authorization in legal documents. So nowadays, signature identification and verification becomes an essential component in automating the rapid processing of documents containing embedded signatures. In this paper, a technique for a bi-script off-line signature identification system is proposed. In the proposed signature identification system, the signatures of English and Bengali (Bangla) are considered for the identification process. Different features such as undersampled bitmaps, modified chain-code direction features and gradient features computed from both background and foreground components are employed for this purpose. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Nearest Neighbour (NN) techniques are considered as classifiers for signature identification in the proposed system. A database of 1554 English signatures and 1092 Bengali signatures are used to generate the experimental results. Various results based on different features are calculated and analysed. The highest accuracies of 99.41%, 98.45% and 97.75% are obtained based on the modified chain-code direction, under-sampled bitmaps and gradient features respectively using 1800 (1100 English+700 Bengali) samples for training and 846 (454 English+392 Bengali) samples for testing.

The current paper focuses on the second scenario, which aims at performance evaluation of off-line signature verification systems on a newly-created large dataset that comprises genuine, simulated signatures produced by unskilled imitators or random signatures (genuine signatures from other writers). Ten systems were evaluated, and some interesting results are presented in terms of accuracy and execution time. The top ranking system attained an overall error of 8.94%. This result interestingly correlates with the top ranking accuracy achieved in a previous signature verification competition at ICDAR 2009.	['sample']

The approach is based on feature extraction of every segment segmented from the signature image. After preprocessed and segmented, the signature image is segmented to some segments. Every segment is represented by a set of seven features. By using these segments and its features, the degree of similarity between the questioned sample and the n genuine signature samples is computed. Only a little number (3 to 5) of genuine samples for each writer is needed by using a simplified version of question document expert’s classifier. Experimental results show our approach is promising to distinguish random and simple forgeries from genuine signatures effectively.	['sample']
graph point matching certain compute edge edit firstly introduced node line finally limited relationship having then respectively susig trained step 	2	On-line signature verification using graph representation	This paper proposes a novel approach of on-line signature verification. Firstly, on-line signatures are represented by a series of graphs, whose nodes and edges describe certain properties at sample points and relationship between points respectively. Then, graph matching techniques are introduced to compute edit distance between graphs, which measures the similarity of graphs. Finally, having been able to compare any two signatures through the last two steps, user-dependent classifiers are trained using limited genuine signatures. The proposed method is tested on SUSIG on-line signature database and shows promising performance.
