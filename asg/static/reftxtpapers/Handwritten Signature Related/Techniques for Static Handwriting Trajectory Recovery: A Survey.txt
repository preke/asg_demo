Abstract
On-line handwriting recognition systems are usually better than their off-line counterparts thanks to the accessibility of dynamic information such as stroke order, velocity, acceleration, and pressure. Whilst the exact value of velocity as well as acceleration or pressure is unlikely to be recoverable, the temporal order of the strokes or the pen trajectory is shown to be more promising for recovery. The published experimental results suggest that the recovered pen trajectory information actually improves the off-line recognition accuracy. This paper presents an overview and discussion of pen trajectory recovery methods developed to date.

1. INTRODUCTION
The research in automatic handwriting recognition has been intensively pursued for nearly four decades and has obtained some significant achievements [57]. Successful applications include: postal address recognition, handwriting recognition and signature verification using tablets, historical document recognition, and form processing.
Automatic recognition systems can be categorised as being on-line or off-line based on the availability of dynamic information. On-line recognition is usually performed using temporal spatial information generated from the movement of a stylus on the surface of an electrostatic or electromagnetic tablet. Depending on the hardware, this signal stream of information may include: pen-inclination, pressure, velocity, acceleration, movement direction, number of strokes. From such information, the corresponding static image could be simulated [59] using ink deposition models in conjunction with trajectory interpolation functions.
Unlike its on-line counterpart, off-line recognition employs only the static images captured by optical devices such as a camera or scanner. Due to the absence of dynamic information, the accuracies of off-line recognition systems could not be as high as on-line recognition [57]. As a trade-off, the on-the-fly collection of dynamic information restricts the applications of on-line recognition and gives off-line recognition certain unique advantages such as the ability to capture information remotely and conveniently.
The success of on-line systems [57] encourages the recovery and utilisation of dynamic information, such as pressure [3] and, especially, stroke order to improve the performance of off-line recognition systems. Research in the field of psychology also suggests that humans’ perception of dynamic information from static images assists in the recognition of characters [4]. It is strongly believed that if the trajectories are properly recovered, the performance of automatic off-line handwriting recognition systems could significantly be improved [56, 69, 11, 7]. Handler et al. [43] reported a recognition performance downgrade when off-line data was simulated using on-line data. Experimental results from [69, 33] later confirmed that the time ordering of the signal contains important information for the recognition of handwriting. In the literature, time ordering information has been used for word segmentation and recognition [56, 33], character recognition [42], numeral recognition [38, 40], writer identification [55]. The application of recovered trajectories in signature verification has also been investigated. In, [60, 58, 53, 73], on-line data which was previously obtained in a registration process provided valuable clues for the recovery of signature trajectory. In another attempt to extract and utilise the temporal order, Munich and Perona [44] tracked the signature images as writers sign with the assistance of a camera. Despite the large number of potential applications, trajectory recovery remains an open problem.
There are two major processes in a trajectory recovery system: local examination and global reconstruction. Local examination provides the essential information which will be referred to in the global reconstruction phase. This often includes the detection and analysis of junctions or ambiguous zones, endpoints, double-traced lines but can also be extended to gray level consistency, striations, feathering, pressures, and accelerations [12]. In global reconstruction,
the overall trajectory is determined using the information obtained from local examination. The outcome of this process can be a list of ranked trajectory candidates which may further be analysed using a knowledge-based module [69]. The principle components of a trajectory recovery system is presented in Figure 1.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The next section, Section 2, presents both the advantages and disadvantages of input material, the skeleton and the contour. Section 3 briefly mentions the preprocessing of input images. Local examination is then detailed in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to global reconstruction techniques. Finally, issues concerning performance evaluation are discussed in Section 6.

2. MATERIAL
Trajectory recovery systems found in the literature employ either the skeleton or the contour of the handwriting. It is believed that a successful trajectory recovery would take advantage of and utilise both the skeleton and the contour.

2.1 Skeleton
The very first work in handwriting trajectory recovery [38, 40, 52, 39] employed 1-pixel line width thinned images, which is often called the skeleton. The main advantage of skeletonbased approaches is computational efficiency whilst maintaining acceptable geometric and topological attributes [34].
Ideally, the skeleton should be identical to the original pen tip trajectory [55]. In fact, traditional thinning methods often produce artefacts, such as bifurcations or elongations and represent original blobs and filled holes by lines instead of loops. Such anomalies incorrectly describe the structure of the source pattern and make the recovery more difficult [40, 19]. Besides, skeletonisation is considered to be highly sensitive to noise [56]. A single isolated background pixel could result in a loop being created. In reality, some re-
searchers [19, 41, 24] exclude unreliable skeleton segments from consideration whilst others treat those as clues and examine their internal structure carefully [59, 26]. Researchers have also investigated specialized handwriting skeletonisation techniques [55, 48, 35, 8, 68, 27].
In [55], the skeletons were interpolated from selected points using B-Splines. The junction spline knots were shared amongst all the incoming branches before being decomposed in separate knots after a fine tuning process. Consequently, the structure of the characters was preserved. Spline knots have also been investigated in [30] where the control points were over generated equidistantly before being selectively removed to obtain the optimal set of control points. These pseudo-skeletonisation techniques were reported to be less sensitive to noise compared to traditional thinning methods.
Despite the ongoing investigation using the skeleton, some researchers suggested that the temporal information cannot be recovered from the skeleton using heuristic rules only [12]. It is belived that each clue about the motion of the writing instrument should be carefully examined in order to recover the trajectories successfully.

2.2 Contour
Another aspect for trajectory recovery is the handwriting contour. Compared to the skeleton, the handwriting contour does not frequently contain anomalies. Each point on the contour matches a position of the pen tip and is a clue for recovery.
In Plamondon and Privitera’s research [56], the contour was employed to recover the trajectory of handwritten words. Initially, curvature local maxima points were employed to locate ambiguous zones. Later on, two branches of a crossing were joined together based on contour curvature smoothness. The proposed system was tuned using a number of databases and the performance was evaluated using an untouched database consisting of 200 words, which were written by six writers. The successful ambiguous zone interpretation rate was reported to be 94% whilst the original pen tip movement recovered was 89%.
In Doermann et al.’s research [9], the handwriting contour has been employed to locate and recover hidden loops in three phases. Firstly, candidate contour segments are located. Secondly, candidates that a-priori do not have an elliptic shape or are not surrounded by a visible loop are discarded. Finally, blobs that meet the elliptic shape requirement are selected. In another work on loop recovery by Steinherz et al. [67], the contour was used to classify holes, identify hidden loops and hidden natural sub-loops.

3. PREPROCESSING
Similar to many other handwriting recognition problems, the performance of trajectory recovery systems are considerably affected by the quality of the handwriting static image. Therefore preprocessing is necessary to stabilise the quality of the input image [57] prior to any further analysis (Figure 1). This process may include, but not limited to, gray-scale conversion, binarization, noise removal, broken stroke restoration [66], contour smoothing.
Conversely, some researchers argue that some preprocessing techniques reduce the robustness of a trajectory recovery system [29]. A popular preprocessing operation such as binarization would deteriorate or even destroy valuable clues such as intensity consistency, continuation, and feathering which could possibly be extracted and utilised using grayscale images [10]. As a result, gray-scale based trajectory recovery techniques have been investigated [29, 28, 54].

4. LOCAL EXAMINATION
Doermann [12] suggested that trajectory recovery techniques can produce useful information when obtained from stroke and sub-stroke features as well as knowledge about the writing process. The detailed taxonomy of temporal clues can be found in [12]. Despite the promising outcomes, Plamondon and Privitera [56] noted that the examination of handwriting at sub-stroke level would be computationally expensive. Local examination includes the following subprocesses: ambiguous zone detection, ambiguous zone analysis, double traced writing and hidden loops analysis, the detection and pairing of endpoints.

4.1 Ambiguous Zone Detection
There are parts of the writing where the establishment of writing order is not straightforward. Many of those are occluded i.e. start/end points, crossings, and touching components. They are often named ambiguities or ambiguous zones. To recover the intrinsic trajectory of the pen movement from a static image, these ambiguities must all be located and analysed.
In skeleton-based approaches, the detection of ambiguous zones often relies on the average stroke width [59, 19]. At these ambiguous zones, the distance from a skeletal point to the nearest background pixel appears to be larger than half the line width. Since line width often varies with writing instruments and writing speed [10], especially in sophisticated handwriting or signatures, handling ambiguous zones this way requires greater care.
In [56], Plamondon and Privitera demonstrated that ambiguous zones can be located using local curvature maxima points of the handwriting contour. According to the authors, curvature maxima of the contour correspond to either the overlap of two consecutive motor strokes or two distinct strokes. Similarly, Zhong-sheng et al. [71] classified handwritten Chinese ambiguous character zones into basic and complex types using discontinuous points [17]. However, the problem of curvature estimation for discrete points itself is not an easy problem [18, 70].
In research into Arabic handwriting trajectory recovery, ElBaati et al. [13] demonstrated that ambiguous zone detection could be performed in a straightforward way. Their technique employs a square window sweeping through the image and counting the number of background regions parted by the foreground. 3 background regions correspond to a ‘Y’ branch point whilst 4 means an ‘X’ crossing.

4.2 Ambiguous Zone Analysis
The analysis and matching of the incoming and the outgoing segments branching from ambiguous zones can be considered
the most crucial and challenging tasks in trajectory recovery [59]. This operation often involves the evaluation of continuity or smoothness for each pair of lines that branch out from the ambiguous zone.
In [40], ambiguous zones in the signatures were analysed using heuristic rules. A signature is then represented by a set of critical points extracted from the recovered trajectory. From this work, a recognition rate of 97% was reported. In [19], two branches are joined if the magnitude of direction variation is smaller than a given threshold. Heuristic rules were also proposed to resolve situations where thresholding failed. A similar approach has also been employed in [24, 23]. In addition to direction, stroke width and length have also been employed to evaluate continuity in [6]. Curvature based continuity functions using Kalman [31], Gaussian [56], and B-Spline fitting [46, 45] have also been investigated. Nevertheless, gray level consistency is considered helpful for this task [10].
Qiao et al. [59] surveyed that 95.8% of all the intersection areas are of degree 4 (joining 4 branches) and 95.1% of those having degree 4 are crossing nodes. This implies that proper analysis of degree 4 intersections would significantly contribute to the overall accuracy. Neural networks have been proposed to distinguish crossing type from other types based on the tangential direction of branches. The tracing through ambiguous zones would also be assisted by the in depth analyses of the skeletal structure.
When the degree of an intersection was small, it was able to list all the topologies for the crossings. In his research, L’Homer [41] noted that this prior knowledge significantly assisted the analysis of the ambiguous zone as well as double traced segments.

4.3 Double Traced Writing and Hidden Loop Analysis
Double traced writing can be defined as a segment of writing which is formed by two consecutive strokes terminating and starting in near opposite directions. A loop, which is made of several strokes, is formed when the writing instrument revisits a previous position while touching the writing surface continuously [67]. Depending on the nature of the writing instrument, a small loop may collapse to a blob, namely a hidden loop. Within context, humans can identify these artefacts relatively easily. Such segments also helps distinguish one letter from another [9]. In a trajectory recovery system, the analysis of double traced writing and hidden loops is often performed after the ambiguous zones have been detected and analysed.
In [26], Kato and Yasuhara provided the taxonomy of double traced writing (D-line) which includes looped (L), proper (P), and spurious (S) D-lines. The angles between branches and writing behaviour were analysed to heuristically detect D-Lines in this research. Similarly, angles between branches were used to construct the weighted matrix of a general graph maximum weighted matching algorithm whose best solution would highlight the D-lines [59].
Intuitively, Abuhaiba et al. [1] suggested that the points lying deep inside the blob are more likely to belong to the

background. The distance to the contour threshold was set to be the distance between the majority of the skeleton pixels and the contour plus 2. Explaining the modest recovery rate of 83.6%, the authors commented that both line width and blob size vary even in the same stroke that caused the introduction of spurious holes which negatively affected the performance of their recognition system. This view is also shared by Doermann et al. [9] who later noted the impracticality of this technique due to the high signal to noise ratio.
In their research, Doermann et al. [9] examined the blobs using the mutual distance measurements between the two sides of a symmetric shape. According to these researchers, a blob often resembles an ellipse. Therefore, after contour partitioning and the selection processes, only blobs that resemble elliptic shapes are considered in the shape analysis process.
In another hidden loop recovery study using the contour, Steinherz et al. [67] used contour bank segments to determine the next course of the pen trajectory. Their approach is to first divide the contour into smaller segments, or atomic entities, using discontinuity points. After that, the relationships between atomic entities are established using heuristic rules. A relationship between two atomic entities can be either correspondent, continual, or discontinual. The identification of hidden loops relies on these relationships.

4.4 End Points Analysis
After all the ambiguous zones have been detected and analysed, all pairs of corresponding start and end points need to be identified before the trajectory can be traced globally. This essential process usually includes the identification of stroke ends and hidden ends, selection of beginning points, merging of broken strokes resulting from preprocessing. Figure 2 illustrates a handwritten word where both start and end points are occluded.
It is agreed that the position of stroke ends largely depends on writing styles. For a recovery system to be successful, such knowledge should be referred to. In Arabic handwriting, branch points and end points are always located to the left of the starting point [13]. For a Latin righthanded writer, the writing usually begins from the top left and progresses downwards to the right [20]. Rousseau et al. [65] investigated the significance of knowledge inherent in handwritten Latin letters in recovering the writing trajectory. The conclusion was that prior knowledge has improved recognition rates.
As stroke ends may be hidden or occluded by other strokes,
especially in isolated characters, the identification of the start points and the end points is not trivial and sometimes impossible. Many researchers have chosen to exclude patterns with hidden ends to simplify the problem [26, 19, 36, 64]. In Rousseau et al.’s research [64], as many as 9% of the isolated character samples were reported to have at least one hidden end and were removed from the experiments. The detection and analysis of end points is even more challenging in multi-stroke handwriting and signatures, which varies greater in style and contains a larger number of ambiguous zones. These facts partly explain why it is observed that there has not been any attempt in the literature devoted to the automatic hidden ends identification problem [64].

5. GLOBAL RECONSTRUCTION
The final process of a handwriting trajectory recovery system is to put every recovered segment and stroke back into correct writing order, namely global reconstruction. This is necessary since the handwriting may consist of more than one pair of pen-down and pen-up events. Moreover, there may still be ambiguities left that cannot be analysed and only global reconstruction can enumerate all possibilities. In this process, the direction of pen movement in each segment is also established.
In their research, Bunke et al. [7] applied the best-first search technique on weighted graph to find the optimal trajectory. The search graph was constructed from the skeleton of characters and the costs were computed with the consideration of the writing direction, path minimization, continuity, and direction of the loop.
In the global graph search approach, the topological structure of the handwriting image is described by a graph. The end points, junctions, touching points are represented by vertices and the lines together with curves are represented by edges. The pen trajectory is finally determined by finding the most appropriate path which traverses every edge exactly once. In Jäger’s research [24, 22], each handwriting segment is represented by a vertex of a weighted graph. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the two corresponding segments join the same junction. The deviation between this pair of vertices is then assigned to this edge. The final trajectory is then determined by finding the Hamilton path which minimizes the curvature cost, which may lead to a combinatorial explosion [25].
In another work concerning single stroke handwriting where the degree of crossings could be equal or less than four [26], Kato and Yasuhara managed to detect double-traced edges and simplified the global reconstruction process to the task of searching for an Eulerian cycle from a directed graph. This technique has also been employed and validated in Rousseau et al.’s research [64] on isolated letter trajectory recovery. The lower degree of crossing constraints also enables ElBaati et al. [14] to breakdown Arabic handwritten word into segments and utilise a genetic algorithm to search for the optimal trajectory.
The recovery of handwriting trajectory can also be assisted with dynamic information to recover handwriting partially [73, 72, 74] or globally [49, 47, 50]. In [47], the trajectories were considered as sequences of position and direction
variations. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were adopted to represent this information extracted from the skeletons of static signature images. The state sequences are then determined by matching the HMM to dynamic exemplars using the Viterbi algorithm [62, 63]. The optimal state sequence is finally selected by comparing the likeliness between the HMMs and its corresponding dynamic sequence exemplar.

6. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
It is apparent that the performance of trajectory recovery techniques is subject to experimental settings. To determine the performance of a trajectory recovery system, the recovered trajectories need to be compared with the online ground truth. This can be performed by either using dual databases which consist of simultaneously generated on-line and off-line data. Another approach is to synthesise offline images using the on-line data [59] and an ink-deposition model such as the one described in [15]. Morphological operators such as bicubic interpolation and anti-aliasing may be employed in latter stages to obtain smoother writing [30].
As demonstrated in the literature, the performance of some trajectory recovery techniques was determined visually [14] or reported indirectly, i.e. recognition accuracy. Visual performance evaluation is feasible only if the number of testing samples is relatively small [26, 6]. Moreover, visual evaluation is subjective, not quantitative, and is prone to error. Some automatic performance evaluation protocols have been proposed to overcome such limitations.
In Niels and Vuurpijl’s research [51], dynamic time warping (DTW), an elastic matching technique, was employed to match the recovered trajectory and the trajectory traced by handwriting experts. In [37], Lau et al. replaced Kendall’s distance in the Feigin and Cohen ranking analysis model by a connection metric for performance analysis. This metric takes into account stroke direction and stroke connection. In more recent research using signatures [50], Nel et al. constructed Hidden Markov Models for the purpose of performance evaluation from online exemplars. These HMMs are capable of identifying insertion, deletion as well as substitution errors quantitatively.

7. FINAL REMARKS
From the literature, it can be concluded that trajectory based features improve the performance of offline handwriting recognition systems. Despite that, research in this area is still sparse. A large proportion of the techniques reviewed require the input patterns to satisfy one or more conditions. Such constraints prevent these techniques from being more commonly deployed in off-line handwriting recognition systems. Table 1 presents the performance of significant trajectory recovery techniques along with their key experimental settings.
Employing a generic handwriting corpus, Plamondon and Privitera [56] obtained a success rate of 89%. Better results were reported when some constraints, such as crossing complexity, number of strokes or line width, were in place. Kato and Yasuhara [26] reported the recovery rate of 91.6% whilst Qiao et al. [59] reported the best recovery rate of 96%. In character recognition, Rousseau et al. [65] achieved a recovery rate of 93.3% when characters with unexpected models are removed from the experiments. Zou and Yan [75] reported a remarkably high recovery rate of 97.6% for numerals. In loop recovery, Doermann et al. [9] reported the best rate of 84%.
Although there is diversity in the approaches, stroke continuity estimation is performed in many, if not all, cases. It is used to detect and analyse ambiguous zones, to detect double traced lines, loops, and blobs. However, most techniques found in the literature to date, estimate this value roughly. We strongly believe that more precise estimation would significantly improve the recovery rate. Potential continuity functions could be derived from handwriting movement models such as Lognormal [16] or Beta-elliptic [5] approaches.
With the recent interest in stroke-level off-line handwriting recognition and signature verification [21], it is expected that trajectory recovery will attract more attention from the handwriting recognition community as it deserves.
