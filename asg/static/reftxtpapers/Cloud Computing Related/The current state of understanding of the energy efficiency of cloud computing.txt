I. INTRODUCTION Cloud computing has been presented as the delivery of computing as a utility, with the potential to transform a large part of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry [1]. The popularity of cloud computing has been growing since 2006 and it is currently the most talked about technology in the ICT industry. Cloud computing is both a business and an economic model. The “cloud” as cloud computing is often referred to, is also an example of a classic disruptive technology. By removing the onus for hardware and software support and maintenance from a user, and making both hardware and software “commodities”, cloud computing offers those who adopt it a major opportunity for reducing hardware and software cost. It also offers potential reduction of IT staff: since there is no longer any hardware or software on site, the maintenance demands are reduced, although it is more likely that the support needs remain, but modified into support for application interfaces and communication systems, rather than the servers and applications themselves. Data
centers and cloud computing services providers also perceive that the widespread adoption of the cloud will bring them more profit and they are doing all they can to promote the technology. The subject has had its share of controversy; ranging from the definition of cloud computing to its energy efficiency. This paper focuses on one area of controversy; the energy efficiency of cloud computing. Daley and Woods noted that the issues around cloud computing energy efficiency are complex [2]. The importance of energy efficiency of ICT and cloud computing has generated lots of discussion, with contributors such as Greenpeace, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Climate Savers Computing Initiative. The debate on the energy efficiency of cloud computing has only begun and it will continue as the technology become well known. Before we consider the energy efficiency of cloud computing, we briefly discuss the various definitions of cloud computing.
II. CLOUD COMPUTING

A. Definition of Cloud Computing
Arif wrote that cloud computing has evolved through a number of phases including grid and utility computing, and application service provision (ASP) [3]. Arif wrote Salesforce.com pioneered the concept of delivering enterprise applications via a website in 1999 followed by Amazon Web Services for storage and computation in 2002. Cloud computing started gaining general popularity in 2006 when Amazon launched its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) as a commercial web service, allowing small businesses and individuals to rent computing resources. After the introduction of Web 2.0, Google and others started to offer browser-based enterprise applications such as Google Apps in 2009. Other technologies enabling the evolution of cloud computing include virtualization and broadband. The many definitions of cloud computing has generated some controversy because the technology is new and not well understood resulting in confusion among IT professionals and vendors. This confusion was captured in “Twenty one experts define cloud computing” when these experts gave twenty one different definitions for cloud computing [4].

Gartner lamented that the contrasting views on cloud computing are causing confusion then added their own definition by defining cloud computing as "a style of computing where scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are provided 'as a service' to external customers using Internet technologies” [5]. IDC defines it as "an emerging IT development, deployment and delivery model, enabling realtime delivery of products, services and solutions over the Internet" [6]. Accenture defines cloud computing as “the dynamic provisioning of IT capabilities, whether hardware, software, or services from a third party over the network” [7]. Kenneth K. Chellappa gave the first academic definition of cloud computing as “a computing paradigm where the boundaries of computing will be determined by economic rationale rather than technical limits” [8]. Ambrust et al writes that “Cloud computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware and systems software in the data centers that provide those services” [1]. Although there are many different definitions for cloud computing, there is a broad consensus on the definition by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). They define cloud computing as: “A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models”. This paper accepts the NIST definition but with the understanding that “network” comprises the telecommunication networks and the Internet. The hope of many is that a standard definition will be found and adopted as the technology matures.
III. COMPONENTS OF CLOUD COMPUTING AND THEIR ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Cloud computing can be considered as a system with three main components.

A. Data Centers
Data centers are at the heart of ICT and essential to the function of communications, business, academic, and government systems. But data centers have been causing concerns because of their high energy consumption [9]. Due to the high demand for data processing and storage, many data centers have been built in the past ten years and their energy consumption doubled between 2000 and 2006 [10]. Jonathan Koomey’s report on the power consumption of servers in the United States and the world is credited for raising the alarm on data center energy consumption [11]. This prompted the enactment of Public Law 109-431 by the Congress of United States in 2006 directing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study data center energy use and opportunities for energy efficiency. The EPA report to Congress confirmed the high amount of energy consumed by
data centers and predicted the energy consumption to double in five years at a cost of $7.4 billion annually [12]. The environmental impact of this high energy consumption is also causing concern because the carbon footprint of ICT has been growing rapidly. It was estimated to be 2% of the global carbon emissions in 2006, equivalent to the emissions of the aviation industry [30]. Data centers accounted for 14% of ICT carbon emissions in 2007 and this is projected to be 18% in 2020 [13]. There have been improvements in the energy efficiency of data centers due to initiatives by governments, organizations, and professionals to tackle the problem. In 2007, Google and Intel started the Climate Savers Computing Initiative, an organization committed to making computers and servers more energy efficient [14]. The Green Grid consortium’s energy efficiency metrics focus on advancing energy efficiency in data centers and computing ecosystems [15].The Climate Group is committed to tackling climate change through a low-carbon future [16]. There is also the Energy Star Data Center Energy Efficiency Initiatives by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [17]. The European TCO certification program ensures that IT and office equipments have minimal impact on the environment [18]. Greenpeace’s Cool IT challenge encourages IT companies to provide technological solutions to fight climate change [19].

B. Communication Networks
Communication networks are the backbone of the cloud computing system. Telecommunication networks and the Internet are the links between cloud users and service providers. Fixed and cellular broadband networks are used to transport data back and forth between the data centers and cloud users. Since cloud computing services are based on remote servers in data centers, users can only access them if they have internet access. The energy efficiency of the Internet has come under intense scrutiny. The exponential growth of the Internet brought with it the need for corresponding growth of equipment required to route the increased traffic [20]. The consequence of this is growth in energy consumption and carbon emissions. Communication networks of broadband enabled countries consume 1% of the world’s total energy consumption; that of the United States of America is 2% to 8% [21]. In 2010 the universities of Leeds and Cambridge reported that Internet consumes between 3% and 5% of global electricity supply and that consumption is growing exponentially [22]. Cellular networks consume 0.5% of the world’s electricity; mobile handsets account for 1% of this consumption while the network accounts for the remaining 99%; the energy bills for cellular networks will increase three times by 2015 [23]. Energy bills account for 50% of the operational cost of mobile communication providers [24]. An editorial in the IEEE Communications Magazine said the unprecedented expansion of wired and wireless networks has resulted in high increase in energy consumption and significant environmental footprint [25]. This means that
measuring the energy efficiency of cloud computing cannot be based only on data centers but also on the networks that enable the provision of cloud services.

C. User Devices
Cloud user devices are described as clients and classified as mobile devices such as PDAs and Smartphones; thin clients, computers without internal hard drives that depend on the servers in the “cloud” to do all computations and display the information for users; thick clients, normal computers that use web browsers to access “cloud” services [26]. There has been a proliferation of user devices used to access cloud computing services. There is now a shift from personal computers towards mobile devices. Gartner predicts that mobile devices will become the dominant Internet accessing devices, saying there will be 1.78 billion PCs and 1.82 billion units of browser equipped mobile devices in use by 2013 [27]. The Smart2020 report predicts that by the year 2020, 50% of the world’s population will own a mobile phone [13]. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) says the mobile-cellular market is the fastest growing telecommunication service market in history, saying there were 5.3 billion mobile-cellular subscriptions worldwide at the end of 2010 compared to the 4 billion of 2008 [48]. The successful launch of the iPad in 2010 led to other companies following with their own tablet machines. The growth in smartphones, notebooks, netbooks and tablet computers, the Google phone and the proliferation of mobile applications are compelling evidence of more users using mobile devices to access cloud computing services like emails and social networks. About 91% of mobile phone users use their phones to access social networking sites compared to 79% of desktop users [28]. Although battery life has been a concern for mobile device users, the energy consumption of mobile phones is low. Mobile handsets account for only 1% of the total energy consumption of cellular networks [23].
IV. RELATED WORK
A. Importance of the energy efficiency of cloud computing The carbon footprint of ICT has been growing at a rapid rate due to the growth of the information society and the introduction of new services. ICT was estimated to be responsible for 2% of the global carbon dioxide emissions in 2006 [29]. The Climate Group has projected the carbon footprint of ICT to be 6% by 2020; that laptops will be the main source of ICT carbon emissions and that carbon emissions in the telecommunication sector will double [13]. ICT will be one of the major greenhouse gas emitters by 2020 [30]. Data centers have been accused of being the main culprits as they are growing rapidly and consuming a lot of energy.
There have been past and current initiatives by governments and organizations to improve the energy efficiency of ICT, especially data centers in order to address the growing concerns about the high energy consumption and carbon footprint. A survey in 2009 found that 44% of data center operators see energy efficiency as a main concern [31]. The Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and its reciprocal, Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCiE) metrics were proposed by the Green Grid to enable data center operators estimate their energy efficiency [32]. The Energy Star certification program for data centers was launched in 2010 to encourage data center operators to improve their energy efficiency [17]. The increased demand for “cloud” services has brought with it the demand for more energy to run the massive data centers delivering the services. As new data centers are being built to meet demand, concern is also growing about the high amount of energy they consumed at a time when the world is concerned about climate change and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Gartner says cloud computing is poised to dominate desktop computing as mobile devices become the dominant internet accessing device [27]. In 2010 social networks overtook search engines on Internet visits from the UK [33]. A survey of IT stakeholders and experts found that majority expect cloud computing to dominate desktop computing by 2020 [34]. A study also found that the value of cloud computing services is growing at a high rate; $46.4 billion in 2008, $56.3 billion in 2009 and projected at $150.1 in 2013 [35]. The attention cloud computing is receiving, the trend towards widespread use due to perceived economic benefits, and the statements and predictions above make the energy efficiency of cloud computing very important. With the growth in use comes an increasing demand for energy to transport and store data in the cloud. The world needs to know the impact cloud computing will have on ICT energy consumption and carbon footprint.

B. Current research and studies on the energy efficiency of cloud computing
Some research have suggested that cloud computing is more energy efficient than traditional desktop computing. In 2010, Jonathan Koomey suggested at an Uptime Institute Symposium that cloud computing can be used as an energy saving tool [36]. Symantec found in a survey that 57% of respondents plan to use Software-as-a-service (SaaS) as a strategy to reduce energy consumption [37]. The Smart2020 report says the mass adoption of cloud computing services can cut carbon emissions [13]. Kumar and Lu propose offloading computations from the desktop into the cloud to save energy [38]. Talbot wrote that one advantage of cloud computing is better energy efficiency because of the offloading of computation and storage to remote data centers [39]. Pike Research forecasts that the adoption of cloud computing will
lead to a 38% reduction in worldwide data center energy expenditure by 2020 [40]. They also said cloud computing will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 28% from 2010 levels by 2020. Nucleus Research in a report says cloud computing business users use 91% less energy than businesses that use on-premise applications [41]. Accenture says businesses can reduce carbon emission from 30% to 90% depending on deployment size [46]. A study for the Carbon Disclosure Project, an independent non-profit organization working for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, says increased adoption of cloud computing will result in a 50% reduction of carbon emissions and energy savings of more than $12 billion annually [47]. The study says cloud computing is the IT solution for the twenty-first century.

C. Challenge to conclusions and findings of current research and studies on the cloud computing energy efficiency
Most of the research and studies on energy efficiency of cloud computing were sponsored by cloud service providers and based on data centers. They make the assumption and conclusion that since data centers have improved in energy efficiency cloud computing is more energy efficient than desktop computing. These assumptions and conclusions have been challenged by other researchers who respond that cloud computing does not depend only on data centers to provide services. They contend that the energy consumption and efficiency of the communication networks that support the provision of cloud services should be considered in the measurement of the cloud’s energy efficiency. Baliga and his group of researchers write in their analysis of energy consumption in data transport, processing and storage in cloud computing compared to desktop computing, that the energy consumption in cloud computing could be higher in data transport when the intensity of computing tasks is high and frequent [42]. Although they agree that when the computing tasks are of low intensity and infrequent cloud computing provides an energy efficient use of computing power. Miettinen and Nurminen on the other hand, wrote that cloud computing has the potential to save mobile clients’ energy if the energy savings from offloading computation exceed the energy cost of the additional communication [43]. According to them, there is the need to consider the energy cost if computation is performed locally and the energy cost for transferring the computation input and output data. For offloading computation to the cloud to be beneficial, the energy cost of computation in the cloud and the cost of input and output data transfer should be less than that of the local computation. We understand that the computation cost in the cloud should also be considered in addition to the data transfer cost. Cloud computing saves energy because of the consolidation of servers, but the energy efficiency savings are negated when one looks at the three cloud applications of storage, software and processing [44]. Cloud computing can be an energy
efficient technology for ICT if its potential for energy savings that have so far focused on hardware can be explored and expanded to system operation and networking [45]. As stated earlier the energy bills for cellular networks is projected to increase threefold by 2015 and the energy consumption of communication networks is growing exponentially. Is this evidence that as more users are adopting cloud computing using mobile and fixed devices, the increase in traffic and data transport is affecting the energy consumption of the networks that support cloud services? Is there a risk of Jevons Paradox when it comes to cloud computing?

D. The two opposing views on the energy efficiency of cloud computing
As stated before there are two opposing views on the energy efficiency of cloud computing. According to Koomey, Pike Research, Nucleus Research, and Accenture cloud computing is more energy efficient than desktop computing. Baliga et al. and Fehrenbacher challenged this assertion when they looked at the impact of data transport, storage and processing on the energy efficiency of cloud computing. Daley and Woods wrote that researchers are only at the beginning of a long investigation and debate because the issues around cloud computing and energy efficiency are much more complex [2]. The debate and discussion will continue until a clear picture of the cloud’s energy efficiency has been developed and produced, taking into consideration the energy efficiency of all the different components that make the cloud computing system.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK This research has focused on the literature on the current state of the energy efficiency of Cloud Computing. The assessment of the energy efficiency of cloud computing cannot be based only on data centers due to the importance of the intermediate communication networks that support the overall activity of providing cloud computing services and the devices used to access cloud services. The other components should be taken into account when measuring the energy efficiency of cloud computing. The energy consumption of mobile devices is generally good but the cellular and fixed communication networks that support cloud services have been noted to consume high amount of energy and this consumption is growing. There is the need to improve the energy efficiency of communication networks and the Internet in order to meet the new levels of demand. The energy optimization of the network infrastructure should be paramount if the improved energy efficiency of data centers will result in overall benefits. Although there has been improvement in data center energy efficiency, the high energy consumption of communication
networks that support the provision of cloud services might negate any such gains. Offloading computation from the desktop to the cloud does not necessary provide an energy efficiency benefit because the demand on communication networks to support this offload, increases the energy consumption of the networks. For offloading of computation to the cloud to be beneficial, the energy cost of computation in the cloud and of transferring the computation input and output data should be less than that of the local computation. For a comprehensive view of the energy efficiency of cloud computing, the energy consumption of communication networks has to be considered as well as that of data centers. Excluding the network from the analysis will not give the full picture of the cloud’s energy efficiency. The picture on the energy efficiency of cloud computing is not yet clear but as the debate and discussion continue and more independent research conducted on the issue, the controversy on the energy efficiency of the cloud will be resolved. There is the need for cooperation between academia and industry to look at how cloud computing will impact on the energy consumption and carbon emission of ICT as the shift towards the cloud gains momentum. In future we intend to design and simulate a network that incorporates all the components of the cloud computing system and measure the energy efficiency of the system. Other research area that needs looking at is the impact of mobile phones on the energy consumption on mobile-cellular networks as mobile devices become dominant in accessing cloud computing services.
