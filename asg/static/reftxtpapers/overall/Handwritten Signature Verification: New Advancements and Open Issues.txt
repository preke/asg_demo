Abstract
Recently, research in handwritten signature verification has been considered with renewed interest. In fact, in the age of e-society, handwritten signature still represents an extraordinary means for personal verification and the possibility of using automatic signature verification in a range of applications is becoming a reality. This paper focuses on some of the most remarkable aspects the field and highlights some recent research directions. A list of selected publications is also provided for interested researchers.

I. INTRODUCTION
The recent years have been characterized by the growing interest toward personal identity authentication, along with the spreading of the internet and the increased demand for security issues. Biometrics is an important field that allows personal identity authentication through the analysis of personal characteristics. Two types of biometrics means can be considered: Physiological biometrics, which involves data derived from the direct measurement of some part of the human body; Behavioural biometrics, which involves data derived from an action taken by a person. Examples of physiological biometrics include fingerprint-, face-, palmprint-, retina-based verification. Examples of behavioral biometrics are speech-, keystroke dynamics- and signaturebased verification [1].
Among the others, handwritten signature is one of the most widespread means for personal authentication. In all developed countries, people learn to affix the signature in the early age and practiced over a period of years. So handwritten signature is a very personal pattern that originates from a complex generation process involving the instantiation of an action plan stored in the brain of the signer and its execution by his/her body (arm, hand) using suitable writing devices (pen, pencil, paper, etc.) [2, 3, 4].
Therefore, it is not surprising that signature analysis is an extremely complex problem that involves aspects of diverse disciplines. Four comprehensive surveys that report the progress in the field of automatic signature verification respectively up to 1989, 1993, 2000 and 2008, provide a comprehensive overview of the efforts done in this research area [5, 6, 7, 72].
The aim of this paper is to highlight some of the most relevant issues at the frontier of research in the field of automatic signature verification. Throughout the paper, some of the most promising directions of research will be pointed out and discussed.
The organization of the paper is the following. Section 2 presents some aspects related to signature acquisition and with the use of new acquisition devices. Some of the crucial questions about signature modelling and representation are discussed in Section 3. The verification strategies are illustrated in Section 4. Section 5 introduce the problem of the assessment of signature verification systems. Some crosscultural and health issues are presented in Section 6. Section 7 briefly introduces some inquiries concerning security, privacy and regulatory matters. Section 8 reports the conclusion of the paper.

VII. SECURITY, PRIVACY AND REGULATORY ISSUES
Data security and privacy are crucial issues to be addressed for assuring a successful deployment of signature verification systems in real life applications. As matter of the fact, feature transformation approaches and biometric cryptosystems have been considered. More recently, a general hybrid approach is proposed for ensuring the protection to biometric templates, that has been applied to on-line signatures. The feature transformation part of the protection scheme relies on the use of Universal Background Models (UBMs), whereas the cryptosystem part is given by a user-adaptive version of the fuzzy commitment cryptographic protocol [66]. Eskander et al. presented a bio-cryptography system that constructs Fuzzy Vaults based on Extended Shadow Codes features extracted from off-line signature images [67].
Legal and regulatory aspects of personal verification by handwritten signature are also very important. Significant results have been achieved recently, since governments and institutions have demonstrated a growing awareness and attention to this important field. As matter of fact, some regulatory aspects have been defined and introduced [68, 69].

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
Handwritten signature is an extraordinary product of human beings and, in the era of the internet, several questions on signature treatment for verification aims still remain open. This paper has tried to point out some of the most remarkable directions of recent research in the field of
automatic signature verification and suggested investigation of research territories.
